##AngularJS Vs Angular

AngularJS and Angular are both web application frameworks created and maintained by Google, but with some key differences. AngularJS, also known as Angular 1, is an older version that uses JavaScript and is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. On the other hand, Angular (commonly referred to as Angular 2 and above) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, utilizing TypeScript and the Component-Based Architecture. Angular offers improved performance, modularity, and features like better dependency injection and server-side rendering. Overall, Angular is a more modern and robust framework compared to AngularJS, offering developers better tools and capabilities for building dynamic web applications.
