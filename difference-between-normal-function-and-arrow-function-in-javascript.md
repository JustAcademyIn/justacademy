##Difference Between Normal Function and Arrow Function in JavaScript

In JavaScript, normal functions and arrow functions are two ways to define functions. Normal functions are defined using the `function` keyword and can have their own `this` context, making them suitable for use as constructors or methods within objects. On the other hand, arrow functions are more concise and have a lexical `this`, meaning they inherit the `this` value of their surrounding code. This makes arrow functions useful for scenarios where you want to maintain the context of `this` without creating a new scope. Additionally, arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object and cannot be used as constructors with the `new` keyword.

1) Normal Function:
   - Defined using the function keyword.
   - Has its own 'this' keyword which is determined when the function is called.
   - Can be used as constructor functions to create new objects.
   - Can be named or anonymous.

2) Arrow Function:
   - Defined using the => syntax.
   - Does not have its own 'this' keyword, it lexically binds this from its enclosing context.
   - Shorter syntax compared to normal functions, making it easier to write.
   - Cannot be used as constructor functions.

3) Normal Function:
   - Best used when 'this' needs to be dynamic based on how the function is called.
   - Can contain statements within the function body, allowing more complex logic.

4) Arrow Function:
   - Best used for non-method functions, where 'this' needs to be fixed to the enclosing context.
   - Ideal for simple, one-liner functions like array methods.

5) Normal Function:
   - Can be hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are defined in the code.
   - Have their own arguments object.
   
6) Arrow Function:
   - Cannot be hoisted, they must be defined before they are used in the code.
   - Do not have their own arguments object, but can still access parent scope's arguments object.

7) Normal Function:
   - Must use the return keyword to return a value from the function.
   - Can have a variable number of parameters using arguments object.

8) Arrow Function:
   - Automatically returns a value if the function body is a single expression.
   - Cannot have a variable number of parameters using arguments object.

9) Normal Function:
   - Better choice when defining methods in classes or object literals.
   - Provides more flexibility in terms of defining functions.

10) Arrow Function:
    - More concise and cleaner syntax, saving time and improving code readability.
    - Ideal for callbacks or event handlers.

11) Normal Function:
    - Use 'function' when you need to access 'arguments' or define a method inside an object.

12) Arrow Function:
    - Use '=>' when you want to maintain the context of 'this' from the surrounding code or for short, concise functions.

13) Normal Function:
    - Can be used with 'new' keyword to create objects using constructor functions.

14) Arrow Function:
    - Cannot be used with 'new' keyword, as they do not have their own 'this' context.

15) Normal Function:
    - Introduced in early versions of JavaScript.
    - More traditional and widely used across different codebases.

16) Arrow Function:
    - Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
    - With the rise of ES6, arrow functions have become more popular due to their simplicity.

17) Normal Function:
    - Potentially slower due to 'this' binding behavior.
  
18) Arrow Function:
    - Generally faster due to the way 'this' is resolved lexically.
  
19) Normal Function:
    - More flexible in terms of defining function expressions.
  
20) Arrow Function:
    - More concise and preferred for many modern use cases due to its simplicity and readability.

These points highlight the key differences between normal functions and arrow functions in JavaScript, helping students understand when to use each type effectively in their code.
