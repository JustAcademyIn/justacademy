## Java Automation

Java automation refers to the use of Java programming language to automate tasks and processes in software applications. It involves writing scripts or programs in Java that interact with various elements of a software application, such as user interfaces, databases, or APIs, to perform automated testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. Java automation is widely used in the field of software development and quality assurance to improve efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and ensure consistent and reliable results. Popular tools and frameworks used for Java automation include Selenium, Appium, TestNG, and JUnit.
