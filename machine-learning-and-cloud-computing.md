Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. Cloud Computing, on the other hand, is a method of delivering computing services over the internet. When combined, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing can provide scalable, cost-effective, and efficient solutions for processing large amounts of data, training and deploying complex machine learning models, and facilitating collaboration and access to resources globally. These technologies are driving innovation and powering advanced applications in various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.
