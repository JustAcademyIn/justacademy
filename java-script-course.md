Java Script is a widely-used programming language that is used to add interactivity, validation, and animation to web pages. The language runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed on the user's computer, making it essential for creating dynamic and engaging websites and web applications. A Java Script course teaches students how to write, debug, and use the language to create interactive elements such as forms, slideshows, and games on a website. It covers topics such as data types, control structures, functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation, providing a foundation for creating modern and dynamic web designs.

5) Advanced Concepts and Projects:
The final point of the Java Script course will cover more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, AJAX, and popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
