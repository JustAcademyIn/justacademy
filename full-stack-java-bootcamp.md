##Full Stack Java Bootcamp
A Full Stack Java Bootcamp is an intensive, fast-paced training program designed to equip participants with a comprehensive range of skills to become proficient full-stack developers, specifically focusing on Java for backend development. These bootcamps are structured to cover both frontend and backend technologies, encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and diving deep into Java for server-side development, along with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. Additional subjects such as database management, version control with Git, and deployment techniques are also integral parts of the curriculum. Aimed at complete beginners or those looking to pivot their careers into tech, these programs offer hands-on projects, real-world simulations, and sometimes career support services, enabling graduates to build a portfolio and potentially land a role as a full-stack developer upon completion.
