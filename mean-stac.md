Mean Stack is a popular open-source web development technology used to create dynamic web applications. It uses a combination of four different technologies: MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express (a web application framework), Angular (a front-end JavaScript framework), and Node.js (a server-side JavaScript runtime environment). By combining these technologies, developers are able to create scalable, efficient, and robust applications that can handle large amounts of data and user interactions. This stack is known for its flexibility, ease of use, and ability to handle real-time applications. It is widely used by startups, enterprises, and developers for building modern and responsive web applications.
