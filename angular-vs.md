##Angular VS

AngularJS and Angular are both popular front-end frameworks developed by Google. AngularJS is the first version of the framework and is based on JavaScript, while Angular (also known as Angular 2+) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and is based on TypeScript. Angular has more features, improved performance, better support for mobile development, and a more structured and component-based architecture compared to AngularJS. It is important to note that AngularJS has reached its end of life and Angular is the recommended choice for building modern web applications.
