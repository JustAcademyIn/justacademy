Software testing courses vary significantly in duration, depending on the depth of knowledge offered, delivery mode (online or physical classroom), and the specific content covered. Broadly, short-term courses or workshops can last from a few days to a couple of weeks, providing an overview of testing principles, tools, and techniques. More comprehensive courses, particularly those aiming for certification (like ISTQB, CSTE, or CTFL), can extend from a few weeks to several months. These longer courses delve deeply into software testing methodologies, test management, automation tools, and often include hands-on projects. Self-paced online courses offer flexibility and can be completed according to an individual's schedule, though completion times can vary widely. Typically, a dedicated learner can expect to invest anywhere from 20 to 100+ hours to gain a solid foundation in software testing.
