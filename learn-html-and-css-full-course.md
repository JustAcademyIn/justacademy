The "Learn HTML and CSS Full Course" is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamentals of web development, focusing on two core technologies essential for creating websites: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). HTML provides the structure for web pages, allowing developers to organize content such as text, images, and links. CSS, on the other hand, is used to control the presentation, layout, and design of these web pages, enabling developers to create visually appealing sites with precise control over fonts, colors, spacing, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. This comprehensive course covers everything from the basics of creating simple web pages to more advanced techniques, including responsive design, animations, and optimizing web pages for performance and accessibility. Through practical examples and projects, learners can apply their knowledge to build their own websites by the end of the course.
