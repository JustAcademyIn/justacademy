Mean, also known as average, is a statistical measure that represents the central tendency of a set of numbers. In programming, it is calculated by adding all the numbers in a dataset and dividing it by the total number of values. Mean is useful for analyzing data and identifying patterns or trends. It is commonly used in various applications, such as data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling, to summarize large amounts of data and make it easier to understand and interpret.
