##Angular and angularjs

Angular is a modern web development framework developed by Google that allows developers to build dynamic and interactive web applications using TypeScript. Angular provides a more structured and component-based approach to building web applications, making it easier to manage complex projects. On the other hand, AngularJS is the older version of the framework, which is based on JavaScript. AngularJS lacks many of the features and improvements introduced in Angular, and is considered outdated by many developers. Therefore, it is recommended to use Angular for new projects to take advantage of its enhanced capabilities and improved performance.

3) Angular, also known as Angular 2+, is the newer version of the framework released in 2016, and is a complete rewrite of AngularJS.
4) Angular uses a component-based architecture, making it more modular and easier to maintain than AngularJS.
5) Both Angular and AngularJS are written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.
6) Angular provides better performance, improved tooling, and support for mobile development compared to AngularJS.
7) Angular has a more modern and intuitive syntax compared to AngularJS, making it more appealing to developers.
8) Angular has a more active community and better long-term support from Google compared to AngularJS.
9) Angular supports server-side rendering, which can improve SEO and initial page load times.
10) Angular has a more powerful dependency injection system compared to AngularJS.
