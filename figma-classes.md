## Figma Classes

Figma classes are a way to organize design elements within a Figma file, making it easier to manage and maintain a consistent design system. Classes allow you to define a set of properties, such as font styles, colors, and spacing, that can be applied to multiple elements throughout your design. By creating and using classes, designers can ensure that their designs are cohesive and follow the established design principles, which leads to a more efficient design process and overall better user experience.
