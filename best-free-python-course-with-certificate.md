##Best Free Python Course With Certificate
As of my last update in 2023, one of the best free Python courses with a certification upon completion is offered by Coursera, as part of their partnership with the University of Michigan—the "Python for Everybody" course. This course, taught by Professor Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck), is highly acclaimed for its comprehensive introduction to Python and programming basics. It covers topics such as data structures, accessing web data, and using databases with Python. Although Coursera typically charges a fee for issuing a certificate, learners can apply for financial aid or audit the course for free, minus the certificate. However, the knowledge and skills gained are invaluable and widely recognized, making it an excellent option for anyone looking to start their journey in Python programming. This course stands out due to its engaging teaching style, practical exercises, and the reputable backing of the University of Michigan, ensuring learners not only gain a strong foundation in Python but also receive recognition for their efforts through a certificate, provided they meet the necessary conditions.
