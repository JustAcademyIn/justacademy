As of my last update in 2023, the best place to learn Laravel, a popular PHP framework, varies based on your learning style and objectives. However, Laravel's own documentation (laravel.com/docs) is widely lauded for its thoroughness and approachability, making it a prime starting point for beginners and experienced developers alike. Additionally, Laracasts (laracasts.com) offers a vast library of high-quality, video-based tutorials covering a wide range of topics from the basics to advanced techniques in Laravel, making it a favorite among developers. This platform is especially renowned for its clear explanations and practical examples. Both resources are highly recommended for anyone looking to dive into Laravel development, combining them can offer a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the framework.
