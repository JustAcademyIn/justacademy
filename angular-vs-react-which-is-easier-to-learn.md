Angular and React are both powerful frameworks for web development, but their learning curves differ due to their architectural complexities and paradigms. Angular, developed by Google, is a full-fledged MVC framework that offers a comprehensive solution out of the box, including things like form validation, state management, and HTTP client utilities. It employs TypeScript, which adds a layer of complexity but ensures type safety and potentially cleaner code. React, developed by Facebook, is not a full framework but rather a library focused solely on building user interfaces. It promotes the development of reusable UI components and leverages JavaScript ES6+ features, which might be more approachable for those with a solid JavaScript background. For beginners, React generally offers a smoother learning curve due to its simplicity and the focus on a smaller subset of application features, compared to Angular's all-in-one approach that requires grasping a broader range of concepts from the start.

Selecting the right framework between Angular and React for a training program can significantly impact the learning curve and productivity of students. Each of these frameworks has its unique features and complexities. Here is a comparison to help decide which might be easier to learn:

1) **Learning Curve**: React has a gentler learning curve compared to Angular. React is a library focused on building UI components, so students can start quickly with fewer concepts to grasp initially. Angular, being a full-fledged MVC framework, has more concepts and features such as dependency injection, RxJS, and TypeScript, making it more complex from the get-go.

2) **TypeScript vs. JavaScript**: Angular applications are built using TypeScript, which adds static types to JavaScript. This might be an extra learning step for students not familiar with types in programming. React, on the other hand, can be used with plain JavaScript or with TypeScript, offering flexibility based on the learner’s comfort with types.

3) **Community and Resources**: Both have strong communities, but given React’s popularity and its simplicity, beginners might find more beginner-friendly tutorials, forums, and discussions for React. This abundance of resources can make the learning process smoother for React compared to Angular.

4) **Conceptual Overhead**: Angular provides a lot of in-built functionality, such as form validation, HTTP services, and more, which is great for building complex applications but also means there’s more to learn upfront. React is more minimalist, giving you the freedom to add only what you need, which might ease the initial learning process.

5) **Documentation**: Angular's documentation is very comprehensive and covers a wide range of topics necessary to build complex applications. However, this can also be overwhelming for beginners. React's documentation is straightforward and, combined with community guides, makes for an easier start for newcomers.

6) **Ecosystem and Tooling**: Angular comes with a powerful CLI that simplifies many tasks such as project creation, configuration, and code generation. This comprehensive package can be advantageous but also requires learners to understand the Angular way of doing things. React’s ecosystem is vast and flexible, but the choice among different tools and libraries for routing, state management, etc., can be initially confusing for beginners.

7) **Data Binding**: Angular uses two-way data binding, which can be more intuitive for beginners, as changes in the UI automatically update the model state and vice versa. React employs a one-way data flow, which helps in understanding the application structure and flow of data but might require a bit more boilerplate code and understanding to manage state changes effectively.

8) **UI Components and Design Philosophy**: React’s component-based architecture is both its strength and simplicity. Understanding and creating components in React can be straightforward. Angular also uses a component-based architecture but intertwines it with directives and modules, which can add layers to the learning process.

9) **Job Market and Demand**: This might not directly affect the ease of learning, but it’s worth considering that React’s popularity has surged, leading to a high demand for React developers. This demand can motivate students to learn and overcome challenges in React. Angular, while also in demand, may see a slightly lesser preference in the job market, potentially affecting motivation.

10) **Personal Learning Preferences**: Ultimately, the ease of learning also comes down to personal preferences and prior knowledge. Students with experience in TypeScript or who prefer a more structured framework might find Angular easier to learn. In contrast, those who prefer a more flexible approach might lean towards React.

**Conclusion**: For absolute beginners, React might present a less steep learning curve due to its simplicity, the flexibility of using plain JavaScript, and a focused approach on building UI components. However, students aiming for positions in enterprises or those who appreciate a full framework approach might find learning Angular more advantageous despite its complexity. 

When designing a training program, consider your audience's background and the goals of the training to choose the most appropriate technology.
