## Machine Learning Framework

A machine learning framework is a software platform that provides the infrastructure and tools necessary to design, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. These frameworks typically include libraries of algorithms, data preprocessing tools, model evaluation metrics, and other functionalities that streamline the process of building and deploying machine learning solutions. Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn are popular choices among data scientists and machine learning engineers for developing a wide range of machine learning applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and recommendation systems.
