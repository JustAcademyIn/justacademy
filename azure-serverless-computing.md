Azure Serverless Computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the allocation of resources and automatically scales them up or down according to demand, eliminating the need for developers to manage servers. It allows for the efficient and cost-effective execution of code without the need for provisioning and managing server infrastructure, thereby enabling developers to focus on writing code and building applications. This model offers a highly scalable and flexible solution for businesses looking to reduce operational costs, improve speed and agility, and streamline their development processes.
