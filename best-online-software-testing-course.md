##Best Online Software Testing Course
As of my last update in early 2023, it's challenging to pinpoint a single "best" online software testing course due to the rapidly evolving nature of technology and individual learning preferences. However, platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and LinkedIn Learning consistently offer high-quality courses that cover a wide range of topics within software testing, including manual testing, automation testing with tools like Selenium and QTP, performance testing, and security testing. Courses such as "Selenium WebDriver Training with Java Basics" on Udemy, "Software Testing and Automation" specialization by the University of Minnesota on Coursera, and numerous courses available on LinkedIn Learning, authored by industry experts, are highly regarded. These platforms frequently update their courses to reflect current best practices and tooling in the industry, and they provide a mix of theoretical knowledge and hands-on projects, making them suitable for both beginners and experienced professionals seeking to enhance their skills. Always check for the most recent reviews and course updates to ensure the content matches current industry standards and your learning objectives.
