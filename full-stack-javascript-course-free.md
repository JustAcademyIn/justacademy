Certainly! A full stack JavaScript course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to develop both the front-end and back-end parts of web applications using JavaScript-based technologies. Here's what a free training program might offer, laid out in points:

1) **Introduction to JavaScript**: Fundamental concepts, syntax, and operations. It covers basic programming constructs like variables, data types, and control statements to set a strong foundation.

2) **Version Control with Git**: Teaches how to use Git for tracking changes in source code during software development, a crucial skill for any developer.

3) **HTML & CSS for Front-End Development**: Introduces building blocks of webpages, focusing on structure (HTML) and styling (CSS), ensuring students can craft responsive and visually appealing websites.

4) **JavaScript for Front-End**: Delves deeper into JavaScript, teaching how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) for dynamic content and interact with APIs for real-time data.

5) **Front-End Frameworks**: An introduction to popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, or Angular, enabling rapid frontend development with modular and maintainable code.

6) **Node.js for Back-End Development**: Covers Node.js, enabling JavaScript to run on the server side. It includes building RESTful APIs, working with file systems, and handling asynchronous operations.

7) **Express.js**: A focus on Express.js, a powerful web application framework for Node.js, teaching how to create server-side logic and routes in a lightweight and efficient manner.

8) **Databases and ORM**: Teaches how to integrate and manipulate databases (both SQL like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and NoSQL like MongoDB) using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries.

9) **Authentication & Authorization**: Guides on implementing secure user authentication and authorization strategies using JWT, OAuth, or session-based authentication.

10) **Testing and Debugging**: Introduces testing frameworks (such as Jest or Mocha) and debugging techniques to ensure the development of reliable and bug-free applications.

11) **DevOps Basics**: Covers fundamentals of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, and basic cloud deployment on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

12) **Soft Skills Development**: Fosters essential soft skills, including problem-solving, effective communication, working in teams, and time management.

13) **Project Work**: Application of learned skills to real-world projects, encouraging students to build their portfolios. This often involves developing a full-stack application from scratch.

14) **Career Services**: Advice on resume writing, preparing for technical interviews, and leveraging online platforms like LinkedIn for job searches, crucial for entering the developer job market.

A free full stack JavaScript course offering such comprehensive coverage can significantly boost the employability and skill set of students, preparing them for various roles in web development and beyond.
