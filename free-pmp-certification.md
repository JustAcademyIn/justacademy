As of my last update, there isn't an official free Project Management Professional (PMP) certification provided by the Project Management Institute (PMI), the organization responsible for the PMP certification. The PMP certification is a highly sought-after credential in the field of project management, signifying expertise and proficiency. It requires meeting specific educational and professional experience criteria, passing a rigorous exam, and an investment in terms of exam fees. However, there are various resources available online, such as study guides, practice exams, and courses, aimed at helping candidates prepare for the PMP exam. Some of these resources are free or offer free trials, providing valuable information and insights without the cost of formal training programs. These can be beneficial for individuals looking to expand their knowledge and prepare for the certification without the significant financial investment of traditional PMP training courses.
