As of my last update in 2023, Free Code Camp does not offer a specific course solely focused on PHP. Free Code Camp is a widely recognized platform that provides free coding lessons and certifications in various domains of software development such as web development, data science, and more, primarily focusing on languages such as JavaScript, Python, and technologies related to full-stack development and responsive web design. However, they have a vast array of learning resources, and it's possible they could expand their offerings to include PHP or related server-side scripting languages in the future. For learners interested in PHP, there are numerous other online platforms and resources dedicated to PHP learning, ranging from beginner to advanced levels.
