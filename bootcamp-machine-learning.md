## Bootcamp Machine Learning

A bootcamp in machine learning is an intensive program designed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career in artificial intelligence and data science. Participants learn various machine learning algorithms, programming languages such as Python and R, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques. These bootcamps often involve hands-on projects and real-world applications to provide practical experience. By the end of the program, students typically have a portfolio of projects and the expertise to tackle complex machine learning problems in industry settings.
