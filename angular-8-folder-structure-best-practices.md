Angular 8 follows a specific folder structure best practices to organize and structure the application code. The basic folder structure includes the root folder, source folder, and configuration files. The source folder contains all the source code files including components, services, and modules. The root folder contains the configuration files such as package.json, angular.json, and tsconfig.json. These files are used to manage dependencies, build, and compile the application. In addition, it is recommended to create separate folders for assets, environments, and tests to ensure better organization and maintainability of the code. This folder structure helps developers follow a standardized approach and makes it easier to navigate and manage the application code.

1) Separation of Concerns: The best practice for organizing an Angular 8 project is to follow the principle of separation of concerns. This means that each component, service, and module should have its own dedicated folder to keep the code organized and easily maintainable.

2) Root Module: The root module of an Angular 8 project is defined in the "app.module.ts" file. It contains the declarations, imports, providers, and bootstrap data for the application. This file should be placed in the "app" folder.

3) Feature Modules: Feature modules are used to group related components, services, and other resources together. These modules should be placed in a separate folder and should have a well-defined purpose, making it easier to manage and scale the project.

4) Shared Module: Shared modules contain resources that are used in multiple feature modules, such as common components, services, and directives. It is recommended to create a "shared" folder to keep all these shared resources in one place.

5) Assets Folder: The "assets" folder is used to store static files such as images, fonts, and other resources that are used in the application. This folder should be placed in the root directory to easily reference these assets in the code.

By following these folder structure best practices, students will be able to better organize their code, understand the project structure, and collaborate with other developers. It will also make it easier to maintain and scale the project in the future.
