##Puppeteer vs Selenium

Puppeteer and Selenium are both popular tools for web automation testing. Puppeteer is a Node.js library developed by Google, while Selenium is a more established tool that supports multiple programming languages. Puppeteer provides a high-level API for controlling and interacting with Chromium or Chrome browsers, making it more user-friendly for those already familiar with JavaScript. On the other hand, Selenium is a versatile tool that supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and offers more flexibility in terms of browser compatibility and languages supported. Ultimately, the choice between Puppeteer and Selenium depends on the specific requirements of your automation project, with Puppeteer being ideal for projects focusing on Google Chrome or Node.js environments, while Selenium is more suitable for cross-browser testing and compatibility.
