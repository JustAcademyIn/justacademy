##Manual Testing Online Course With Certificate
A manual testing online course with certification is designed to equip learners with the fundamental principles and techniques of software testing carried out manually, without the use of automated tools. These courses typically cover topics such as test planning, design, test case development, defect tracking, and various types of testing like system, integration, acceptance, and regression testing. The curriculum often includes hands-on projects or case studies to provide practical experience. Upon successful completion, participants receive a certificate, validating their skills and knowledge in manual testing. This certification is beneficial for individuals looking to begin or advance their career in software testing, quality assurance, or related fields, as it demonstrates proficiency to potential employers and can enhance job prospects.

1) **Introduction to Manual Testing Concepts**: This crucial part of the course starts with defining what manual testing is, detailing its importance in the software development life cycle (SDLC) and explaining fundamental concepts such as software bugs, test cases, and testing types (functional, integration, system).

2) **Understanding Testing Lifecycles & Methodologies**: Students will be introduced to different testing lifecycles such as the V-Model and Agile Testing, as well as methodologies like black box testing, white box testing, and gray box testing, emphasizing their applications in the manual testing process.

3) **Test Plan Creation and Management**: This section focuses on how to create comprehensive test plans that outline the testing strategy, objectives, schedule, estimations, and resources. It also covers managing and updating test plans as the project evolves.

4) **Writing and Executing Test Cases**: Students will learn how to develop test cases that are effective and efficient. This includes formulating test scenarios, identifying expected outcomes, and executing test cases manually to catch bugs or defects in the software.

5) **Defect Tracking and Management**: The course will cover tools and techniques for tracking defects discovered during testing. Students will learn how to document defects, prioritize them for fixes, and track their status through to resolution.

6) **Risk Management and Mitigation in Testing**: Students are guided on how to identify potential risks in software projects and create mitigation strategies. This includes assessing risk impact and probability, and implementing contingency plans.

7) **Manual Testing Tools**: Although the focus is on manual testing, this section introduces students to basic tools that can help facilitate the manual testing process such as JIRA for bug tracking, and TestLink for test management.

8) **Quality Assurance Best Practices**: This part of the course educates on the best practices for ensuring the highest quality in software products, including peer review techniques, test environment setup, and maintaining testing documentation.

9) **Soft Skills for Testers**: Recognizing that technical skills alone do not make a successful tester, this module focuses on essential soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork.

10) **Preparing for a Career in Manual Testing**: This final module aims to prepare students for entering the workforce as manual testers. It covers preparing an effective resume, understanding the roles and responsibilities of a tester, and tips for acing job interviews.

11) **Certification Preparation and Exam**: At the end of the course, students will be prepared to take a certification exam that validates their understanding and skills in manual testing. Information about the exam format, sample questions, and study tips are provided.

12) **Ongoing Learning and Professional Development**: This concluding segment encourages students to continue their professional development, suggesting resources for advanced learning, networking opportunities, and industry conferences.

By offering a comprehensive online course with a certification in manual testing, educational institutions can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling students to enhance their skills and employability in the IT and software development sectors.
