##Javascript Es6

JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the language that introduced many new features and enhancements to make coding more efficient and expressive. Some key features include arrow functions for concise syntax, template literals for easier string interpolation, let and const for block-scoped variables, classes for object-oriented programming, and destructuring for extracting values from arrays and objects. ES6 also introduced promises for cleaner asynchronous code handling, modules for better code organization, and the spread and rest operators for working with arrays and function parameters more easily. Overall, ES6 revolutionized the way developers write JavaScript code, making it more powerful and easier to work with.
