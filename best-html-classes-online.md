Creating and delivering an effective online training program in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for students requires careful planning and execution. Below are several points highlighting key aspects of designing the best HTML classes online:

1) **Comprehensive Curriculum**: The curriculum should cover all fundamental aspects of HTML, from basic to advanced topics, including tags, elements, attributes, forms, and semantic HTML. It should also introduce recent HTML5 specifications.

2) **Interactive Learning Environment**: Incorporate interactive tools such as code editors and sandbox environments where students can practice writing and testing their HTML code in real-time. This hands-on experience is crucial for effective learning.

3) **Modular Course Design**: Break the course into smaller, manageable modules or lessons. Each module should focus on a specific topic, making the content easier for students to understand and master.

4) **Engaging Video Tutorials**: Provide high-quality video tutorials that clearly explain concepts with visual aids and real-life examples. Ensure these videos are accessible on various devices to accommodate different learning styles.

5) **Assessments and Quizzes**: Include regular quizzes and tests to assess the students' understanding of the material. Feedback from these assessments can help students identify areas for improvement.

6) **Project-Based Assignments**: Encourage learning by doing through project-based assignments that challenge students to use HTML in practical scenarios, such as creating a personal website or a simple web application.

7) **Expert Instructors**: Ensure that the instructors leading the online classes have substantial real-world experience and a deep understanding of HTML. They should be able to provide insights beyond the textbook and solve students' queries effectively.

8) **Peer Collaboration and Forums**: Create online forums or discussion boards where students can collaborate, share ideas, and help each other. This fosters a community learning environment.

9) **Up-to-date Content**: Technology evolves rapidly, and so do web standards. Regularly update the course material to reflect the latest best practices and HTML specifications.

10) **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Make the course accessible to as many students as possible by adhering to web accessibility standards. This includes providing subtitles for videos, enabling keyboard navigation for interactive tools, and using clear, inclusive language.

11) **Certification and Badge System**: Offer certificates or digital badges upon course completion. These can motivate students and serve as a testament to the skills they've acquired.

12) **Flexible Scheduling**: Since students might be enrolling from different time zones or balancing other commitments, providing self-paced learning options can make the training more accessible.

13) **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a system where students can provide feedback on the course material, teaching methods, and their overall learning experience. This feedback is invaluable for continual improvement of the class.

14) **Career Guidance and Resources**: Supplement the technical training with resources on how to effectively use HTML skills in the job market, including resume tips, portfolio development, and interview preparation.

By carefully considering these points, an online training program can provide a comprehensive, engaging, and practical learning experience in HTML for students, equipping them with the skills necessary to excel in the web development field.
