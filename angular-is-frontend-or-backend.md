##Angular Is Frontend Or Backend

Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework that allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications. Although it primarily operates on the client side, Angular can interact with back-end services and APIs to retrieve and display data to users. Therefore, while Angular is considered a front-end technology, it can work in conjunction with back-end technologies to create full-stack applications.
