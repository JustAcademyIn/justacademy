## Machine Learning for Computer Security

Machine learning plays a crucial role in computer security by enabling automated detection and response to cyber threats. By analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns and anomalies, machine learning algorithms can detect malware, intrusions, and other security breaches in real time. These algorithms can also improve the accuracy of threat identification and reduce false positives compared to traditional security tools. Moreover, machine learning can be used for adaptive security measures such as anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, and predictive modeling to stay ahead of evolving threats in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.
