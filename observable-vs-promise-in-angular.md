##Observable VS Promise In Angular

In Angular, Observables and Promises are both used for handling asynchronous operations, but they have some key differences. Observables are more powerful and versatile, as they can handle multiple values over time and also provide a wide range of operators for transforming and combining data streams. On the other hand, Promises are simpler and can only handle a single asynchronous operation, returning a single value in the end. Observables are recommended for more complex scenarios, while Promises are suitable for simpler cases where only a single value is expected. Overall, Observables provide better support for handling reactive programming in Angular applications.

1) Observable and Promise are both used in Angular for handling asynchronous operations.
2) Observable represents a stream of data that can be listened to over time.
3) Observables are declarative, meaning they specify a behavior, but do not trigger it until they are subscribed to.
4) Observables can handle multiple values over time, making them ideal for handling events and data streams.
5) Observables can be cancelled and retried using operators to manipulate the data stream.
6) Observables are lazy, which means they do not emit values until they are subscribed to.
7) Promises represent a single future value that will be resolved either successfully or unsuccessfully.
8) Promises are eager, meaning they start execution immediately upon creation.
9) Promises only return a single value and cannot be cancelled once initiated.
10) Promises are not cancellable but can be chained using 'then' method to handle successive actions.
11) Observables are more flexible compared to promises in Angular as they can provide multiple values over time.
12) Observables are often used in Angular for handling data streams from HTTP requests or events.
13) Promises are more suitable for simpler operations where only a single value will be returned.
14) Observables provide a wide range of operators for manipulating, filtering, and transforming data streams.
15) Observables can be easily converted to promises using 'toPromise()' method in Angular.
16) Promises do not have as many operators as Observables for data manipulation.
17) Observables can be subscribed to using the 'subscribe' method and can listen to changes in the data stream.
18) Both Observables and Promises can handle errors using the 'catchError' or 'catch' methods.
19) Promises are easier to understand for developers who are new to asynchronous programming as they resemble traditional synchronous operations.
20) For a training program, it is recommended to teach both Observables and Promises in Angular to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of asynchronous programming techniques.
