## CPA digital marketing

CPA digital marketing, short for cost per action, is a performance-based advertising model where advertisers only pay when a specific action is taken by a user, such as a form submission, app installation, or sale. This model shifts the risk from the advertiser to the publisher, as they are only charged when a desired outcome is achieved. CPA digital marketing allows for precise targeting and measurement of campaigns, making it an effective and efficient way for businesses to drive results and achieve their marketing objectives.
