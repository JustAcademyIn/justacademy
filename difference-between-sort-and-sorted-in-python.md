##Difference between sort and sorted in Python

In Python, the difference between `sort` and `sorted` lies in how they affect the original list. The `sort()` method is used to sort elements in-place within the list itself, modifying the original list. On the other hand, the `sorted()` function creates a new sorted list from the elements of an iterable but does not modify the original list. `sort()` modifies the original list, while `sorted()` returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.

1) **SORT** function in Python is used to sort a list in place, meaning it modifies the original list, whereas the **SORTED** function creates a new sorted list without modifying the original list.

2) When using the **SORT** method, the original list is rearranged and sorted within the same memory location, whereas the **SORTED** function creates a new list object with the sorted elements.

3) The **SORT** method has the advantage of being faster and more memory-efficient when sorting large lists, as it directly modifies the original list, saving memory space.

4) On the other hand, the **SORTED** function is useful when you want to keep the original list unchanged and create a sorted copy for further processing or comparison.

5) The **SORT** method does not return a new list; it sorting the list in place and returns None, whereas the **SORTED** function returns a new sorted list as the output.

6) One important point to note is that the **SORTED** function can be applied to any iterable object, not just lists, whereas the **SORT** method is specific to list objects.

7) The **SORT** method cannot be used with other data types, such as tuples or strings, as it directly modifies the list, whereas the **SORTED** function can be used with any iterable object.

8) When using the **SORT** method, the original list elements will be rearranged based on the sorting algorithm used, while the **SORTED** function creates a new list with sorted elements based on the original list's contents.

9) If you want to sort a list without changing the original order, you can use the **SORTED** function, which provides a sorted copy of the input list.

10) The **SORT** method is generally more efficient for large lists since it saves memory by not creating a new list, compared to the **SORTED** function, which creates a new sorted list object.

11) Although the **SORTED** function is slower and less memory-efficient for large lists, it is preferred when you need to preserve the original list order, as it creates a new list with sorted elements.

12) The **SORT** method uses an in-place sorting algorithm, which directly modifies the list, making it useful for situations where memory optimization is a concern.

13) In contrast, the **SORTED** function uses a stable sorting algorithm to create a new sorted list, ideal for scenarios where you want to keep the original list intact.

14) If you need to sort a list of custom objects based on specific criteria, you can use the **SORTED** function with a custom key function or comparator, allowing for more flexibility in sorting.

15) The **SORT** method is a mutative operation that changes the original list, which may not be desirable in some programming scenarios, while the **SORTED** function is non-mutative, creating a sorted copy.

16) While the **SORT** method is more commonly used for sorting lists due to its efficiency and memory optimization, the **SORTED** function offers flexibility and versatility for various sorting needs.

17) It is essential to consider whether you need to modify the original list when choosing between the **SORT** method and the **SORTED** function, as each has its advantages depending on the use case.

18) Another key difference is that the **SORT** method does not return a new list but instead sorts the original list in place, whereas the **SORTED** function returns a new list with sorted elements.

19) The **SORT** method is a list method, meaning it can only be used on list objects, while the **SORTED** function is a built-in function that can be applied to any iterable object.

20) Understanding the distinction between the **SORT** method and the **SORTED** function in Python is essential for efficient list manipulation and sorting operations, providing programmers with the necessary tools to manage data effectively.
