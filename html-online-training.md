HTML (HyperText Markup Language) online training is a structured educational program designed to teach learners the foundational language of the web, HTML, through an interactive online format. This type of training typically covers the basics of web page structure, including how to use tags to structure content, build links, insert images, create tables, and form elements. It often incorporates both theoretical and practical sessions, where learners can write and test their own HTML code in real-time. Online HTML training courses are ideal for beginners aspiring to become web designers or developers and for professionals looking to update their skills. These courses offer the flexibility to learn at one's own pace and may include video tutorials, live sessions, quizzes, and assignments to ensure comprehensive understanding and application of HTML in real-world projects.
