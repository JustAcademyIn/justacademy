PHP MySQL training typically focuses on teaching individuals how to effectively utilize PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), a widely-used open-source scripting language, along with MySQL, a popular open-source relational database management system. This training aims to empower participants with the skills to create dynamic and interactive websites or web applications. Through the course, learners are introduced to the basics of PHP programming, such as syntax, functions, and object-oriented programming, as well as how to integrate PHP with MySQL to manage databases, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and secure data. The training usually includes practical hands-on sessions where participants get to build projects that reinforce their learning, making them competent in developing real-world web applications that require data storage and retrieval.
