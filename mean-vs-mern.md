##Mean Vs Mern

Sure! Mean and MERN are two different stacks used in web development. Mean stack stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js which are all JavaScript-based technologies used to build web applications. On the other hand, MERN stack includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, where React is used as the front-end framework instead of Angular. Both stacks are popular choices for developing modern web applications, with Mean being more suited for Angular developers and MERN for React developers.
