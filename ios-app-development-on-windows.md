iOS app development on Windows is the process of creating software applications for Apple's iOS operating system using a Windows computer. This can be achieved through various methods such as using cross-platform development tools or using virtual machines. While it is not officially supported by Apple, developers can use this approach to build and test iOS apps on a Windows machine before deploying them to the App Store. However, it may have some limitations and may not provide the same level of performance and functionality as using a Mac computer.
