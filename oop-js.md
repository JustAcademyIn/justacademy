OOP JS (Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to create objects that have properties and methods, similar to real-world objects. It provides a more organized and efficient way of writing code by promoting modularity, encapsulation, and code reusability. With OOP JS, developers can easily create complex applications, as objects can be created, inherited, and modified to suit specific use cases. This approach also helps in avoiding code duplication and improves the overall maintainability and scalability of the code. Ultimately, OOP JS enables developers to write cleaner, more efficient, and easier to debug code.
