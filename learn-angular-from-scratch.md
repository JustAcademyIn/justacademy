## Learn Angular from Scratch

Learning Angular from scratch involves understanding the core concepts of the framework such as components, directives, services, modules, dependency injection, data binding, and routing. Starting with setting up the Angular development environment, learning TypeScript, and grasping the basics of Angular CLI, you can gradually build more complex applications by practicing with real-world projects and leveraging resources like official documentation, tutorials, and online courses. Familiarizing yourself with Angular's architecture, best practices, and latest features like Angular Ivy will enable you to develop robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Embracing a hands-on approach, continuous learning, and seeking community support will further enhance your skills in mastering Angular development.
