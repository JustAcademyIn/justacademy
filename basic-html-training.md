Basic HTML training is a foundational course designed for individuals eager to learn the essentials of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the standard markup language used to create web pages. This training typically covers the structure of HTML elements such as tags, attributes, and their proper use in defining the layout and organization of a webpage. Participants learn to create documents with headers, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables, while also being introduced to concepts like forms and input elements for user interaction. By the end of the course, learners are expected to have a solid understanding of how to construct web pages from scratch, enabling them to further explore web development, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This basic training serves as a stepping stone into the broader world of web design and development, empowering individuals with the skills to create effective and visually appealing web content.
