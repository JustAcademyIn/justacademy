Agile PMP Certification Training focuses on equipping project managers with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage projects using Agile methodologies. This training bridges the conventional project management approach of the Project Management Institute (PMI) with Agile techniques, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability required for rapid and incremental project delivery. Participants learn about Agile principles, frameworks (like Scrum, Kanban, Lean), and practices (such as Agile planning, estimation, and leadership), integrating these with the PMI's standard project management body of knowledge. This training prepares professionals for the Agile Project Professional (PMI-ACP)® exam or incorporates Agile methodologies within a PMP certification context, thereby enhancing their effectiveness in managing projects in dynamic and complex environments.
