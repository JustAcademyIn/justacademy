A PHP Basic Course is designed for beginners who aim to gain foundational knowledge in PHP, a popular server-side scripting language widely used for web development. This introductory course typically covers the essentials of PHP, including syntax, variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and basic error handling. Students also learn how to embed PHP code into HTML to create dynamic web pages, manage session control, and interact with databases, particularly MySQL, to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The course is structured to provide hands-on experience through practical exercises and projects, ensuring that participants not only understand the theoretical aspects of PHP but also acquire the skills to build simple web applications. By the end of the course, students are expected to have a solid foundation in PHP, equipping them with the necessary tools to further explore web development using PHP and related technologies.
