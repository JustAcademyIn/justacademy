##Salesforce VS DevOps

Salesforce is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps organizations manage their sales, marketing, and customer service activities. DevOps, on the other hand, is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and automate processes for faster and more reliable software delivery. While Salesforce focuses on enhancing customer interactions and driving business growth through its CRM capabilities, DevOps focuses on streamlining and automating the software development and deployment processes to enable faster delivery of high-quality software. Both Salesforce and DevOps play crucial roles in enabling organizations to innovate, improve efficiency, and deliver value to customers, albeit in different ways.
