React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android devices, providing a faster and more efficient way of creating mobile apps compared to traditional native development. With its component-based architecture, hot reloading feature, and access to native APIs, React Native offers a seamless development experience for building high-performance, native-like mobile apps.
