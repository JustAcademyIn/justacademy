## UI Classes

UI classes, short for User Interface classes, are often used in programming to create and manage the visual components of an application's user interface. These classes are responsible for defining the layout, appearance, and behavior of elements such as buttons, text fields, menus, and other interactive elements that users interact with. UI classes typically contain methods and properties that allow developers to customize the visual aspects of the interface and handle user interactions. By using UI classes, developers can create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance the overall user experience of the application.
