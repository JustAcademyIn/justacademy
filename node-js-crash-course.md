## Node Js Crash Course

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It is widely used for building server-side applications and APIs due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. In a crash course, you would learn the basics of Node.js including setting up a development environment, creating a server, handling requests, working with modules, and understanding asynchronous operations. This crash course would provide you with a solid foundation to start building scalable and efficient applications with Node.js.
