##Difference between Page and Post in WordPress

In WordPress, pages are typically used for static content such as About Us, Contact, or Services pages, and they are not usually time-sensitive. They are hierarchical and can be organized into parent and child pages. On the other hand, posts are entries listed in reverse chronological order on a blog or website, and they are more dynamic and time-based, such as news articles, blog posts, or updates. Posts are categorized and tagged for easier navigation and discovery by users.
