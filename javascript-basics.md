##Javascript Basics

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for web development. It allows you to create interactive websites by adding dynamic content, handling user input, and updating page elements in real time. JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning it runs on the user's browser rather than on a server. It is primarily used to enhance user experience and create engaging web applications. With JavaScript, you can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), interact with APIs, create animations, validate forms, and much more. Understanding JavaScript basics, such as variables, data types, functions, and control flow, is essential for building robust and interactive web applications.
