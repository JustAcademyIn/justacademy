As of my last update in April 2023, numerous platforms and educational institutions offer free online courses for aspiring software testers. These courses are designed to equip students with the fundamentals of software testing, including various testing techniques, tools, and methodologies. Typically, a free online course on software testing covers topics such as test planning, design, execution, and reporting, along with an introduction to automated testing tools. Additionally, learners might gain insights into Agile testing methodologies, bug tracking, and the role of a software tester in the development lifecycle. These courses often employ a mix of video lectures, readings, quizzes, and practical assignments to ensure comprehensive learning. While they are free, some platforms may offer a certification for an additional fee. These courses are invaluable for beginners looking to start a career in software testing or professionals aiming to refine their testing skills.
