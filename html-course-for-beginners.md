Sure, here's an outline of an HTML course designed for beginners, structured to offer a comprehensive training program to students:

1) **Introduction to HTML**: This initial module would provide an overview of what HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is, its significance in creating web pages and applications, and a brief history about its evolution. Basic concepts like tags, elements, and attributes would be introduced.

2) **Setting Up the Environment**: This section would guide students on how to set up a basic development environment on their computers. It would cover text editors suitable for writing HTML, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, and how to view HTML files in a web browser.

3) **Understanding Basic Tags**: Students would learn about fundamental HTML tags here, including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, etc. The idea would be to get comfortable with the structure of an HTML document and the role of these basic tags.

4) **Formatting Content**: Here, emphasis would be placed on tags used for formatting text, like `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<strong>` and `<em>` for emphasis, and more. This would help students understand how to structure and style content effectively.

5) **Creating Lists**: The course would delve into the creation of ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, and how to use the list item (`<li>`) tag. This module would aim to teach students how to organize content in list formats.

6) **Adding Links and Images**: Students would learn the importance of adding hyperlinks (`<a>` tag) and images (`<img>` tag) to web pages. This section covers attributes like `href`, `src`, `alt`, and best practices for linking resources and displaying images.

7) **Tables and Forms**: This part of the course would introduce the concept of creating tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) for tabular data and forms (`<form>`, input fields, and buttons) to collect user input, explaining the significance and usage of each element involved.

8) **Embedding Multimedia**: Students would be taught how to embed multimedia content like video and audio through HTML5 tags such as `<video>` and `<audio>`, enhancing the interactive experience of web pages.

9) **Introduction to CSS**: Though primarily an HTML course, a basic introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) would be provided to explain how HTML elements can be styled. This would cover incorporating CSS into HTML, understanding selectors, properties, and values.

10) **Best Practices**: In this critical section, focus would be on teaching students best practices in HTML coding, including readability, accessibility, and semantic HTML. This aims at fostering good coding habits from the start.

11) **Project Work**: The course would culminate in a project where students would apply what they've learned to create a basic web page or a small website. This practical application helps solidify concepts and skills.

12) **Further Resources and Next Steps**: Lastly, students would be provided with resources for further learning. This might include recommendations for websites, online communities, books, and follow-up courses on more advanced topics like JavaScript and responsive web design.

This broadly outlined HTML course for beginners would aim to equip students with a solid foundation in creating web content, setting the stage for more advanced studies in web development.
