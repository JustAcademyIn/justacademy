HTML, CSS, and JavaScript training courses are designed to provide students and professionals with the foundational skills and knowledge required to create and design modern websites and web applications. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and laying out web pages, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of their projects. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a powerful scripting language that enables interactivity, dynamic content, and the creation of sophisticated web functionalities. Training in these technologies typically covers basics to advanced topics, including responsive design, animations, Front-End development practices, and an introduction to frameworks and libraries like React or Angular. Such training can be delivered through online courses, boot camps, or traditional classroom settings, aiming to equip individuals with the skills necessary to pursue careers in web development and design.
