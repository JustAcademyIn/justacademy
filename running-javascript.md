JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to websites. It is a client-side language, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. This allows for dynamic content and behavior on web pages, such as form validation, animations, and interactive features. JavaScript is written in plain text and embedded directly in HTML documents, making it easy to add and modify code. It is widely used in web development and can also be run on servers using frameworks like Node.js.
