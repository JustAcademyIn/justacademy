##CodeIgniter vs laravel

CodeIgniter and Laravel are both popular PHP frameworks for web development, but they have some key differences. CodeIgniter is known for its simplicity, lightweight footprint, and ease of use, making it a good choice for beginners or small projects. Laravel, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive framework with a wide range of built-in features, tools, and support for modern PHP practices like dependency injection and Eloquent ORM. It also offers robust security features and scalability. Overall, while CodeIgniter is great for quick and simple projects, Laravel is better suited for larger and more complex applications due to its rich feature set and development ecosystem.
