##ACP vs ASP

ACP, or Adjusted Cost Base, and ASP, or Average Selling Price, are both important considerations when analyzing investments. ACP refers to the total cost of an investment adjusted for factors such as commissions, dividends, and stock splits. It helps investors determine the true cost of their investment and calculate potential gains or losses accurately. On the other hand, ASP is the average price at which a product or service is sold over a specific period. It is often used by businesses to assess pricing strategies, monitor market trends, and determine profitability. While ACP is more focused on the investor's perspective and cost basis, ASP provides insights into sales performance and customer behavior. Both metrics are valuable in different contexts and can help stakeholders make informed decisions.
