##Selenium 3 VS Selenium 4

Selenium 3 is a widely used open-source automation tool for testing web applications and supports various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#. It has been a popular choice for web automation testing due to its stability and reliability. However, Selenium 3 had limitations such as lack of support for modern web standards and technologies. On the other hand, Selenium 4 is the latest version of the Selenium web automation tool that addresses many of the shortcomings of its predecessor. It offers new features like improved W3C WebDriver protocol support, better browser compatibility, enhancements in the Selenium Grid, and a more user-friendly API. Overall, Selenium 4 provides a more robust and efficient automation testing experience compared to Selenium 3.
