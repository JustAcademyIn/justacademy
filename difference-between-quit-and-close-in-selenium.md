##Difference between QUIT and CLOSE in Selenium

In Selenium, the "quit" command is used to close the browser and end the WebDriver session, releasing all the associated system resources, such as memory and CPU. On the other hand, the "close" command is used to close the currently focused browser window or tab. If there is only one browser window open, using "close" is equivalent to "quit" as it will also end the WebDriver session. However, if there are multiple browser windows open, using "close" will only close the current window without ending the session, allowing you to continue working with any remaining windows. It is important to choose the appropriate command based on whether you want to close just the current window or terminate the WebDriver session altogether.

1) **Quit method in Selenium:**
   - The `quit()` method in Selenium is used to exit the entire browser session and close all windows and tabs associated with it.
  
2) **Close method in Selenium:**
   - The `close()` method in Selenium is used to close the current browser window or tab that the WebDriver is currently controlling.

3) **Difference in functionality:**
   - While the `quit()` method terminates the entire browser session, the `close()` method only closes the current window or tab being controlled by the WebDriver.

4) **Effect on multiple windows or tabs:**
   - When `quit()` is used, all windows and tabs opened by the WebDriver are closed. However, using `close()` will only close the current window, leaving other windows or tabs open if any.

5) **Resource management:**
   - `quit()` helps in better resource management by ensuring that all resources associated with the WebDriver session are released, while `close()` is more focused on managing the individual windows or tabs.

6) **Handling multiple windows:**
   - If multiple windows or tabs are opened during a WebDriver session, `quit()` is preferred to ensure all are closed properly. Using `close()` in such situations may result in leaving some windows or tabs open unintentionally.

7) **Scenario-based usage:**
   - In scenarios where the test script needs to close the entire browser session after completion, `quit()` is recommended. On the other hand, if the script only needs to close a specific window or tab without terminating the session, `close()` can be used.

8) **Impact on subsequent operations:**
   - After calling `quit()`, the WebDriver instance is no longer usable for any further operations, as it has effectively ended the session. However, `close()` allows the WebDriver to continue working with any remaining windows or tabs.

9) **Session handling:**
   - `quit()` is often used at the end of the test script to ensure proper cleanup and termination of the WebDriver session. In contrast, `close()` is used to manage individual browser windows during the script execution.

10) **Best practices:**
    - It is recommended to use `quit()` when the WebDriver session has completed all tasks, to ensure proper closure of all browser elements. `close()` is used more selectively to handle specific windows or tabs within the session.

11) **Training program for students:**
    - When conducting a training program for students on Selenium, it is crucial to emphasize the difference between `quit()` and `close()` methods to ensure they understand the implications of each function on browser session management. Providing hands-on exercises where students practice using both methods in different scenarios can help reinforce their understanding of when to use `quit()` and when to use `close()` for effective WebDriver session handling.
