The best source to learn python would be to start with online courses or tutorials offered by websites like Codecademy, Coursera, or Udemy. These sources provide structured and comprehensive lessons from beginner to advanced levels with practical exercises to improve coding skills. Additionally, reading books on python such as "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart or "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz can also greatly aid in understanding the language. It is also helpful to practice coding challenges on websites like LeetCode or HackerRank to reinforce the concepts learned. Overall, combining online resources, books, and hands-on practice is the most effective way to learn python.
