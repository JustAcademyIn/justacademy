##Python Tutor Online
Python Tutor, developed by Philip Guo, is an online tool designed to help individuals learn and teach programming, specifically with Python among other languages like Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++. This interactive platform visually illustrates how code executes in real-time, making it easier for learners to understand complex programming concepts and for instructors to explain them. It allows users to step through their code line-by-line, witnessing the changes in variable states and memory allocation throughout the execution process. By providing a clear visual representation of how code runs, Python Tutor aids in demystifying the intricacies of programming, making it an invaluable resource for beginners and educators alike in the coding community.
