As of my last update in early 2023, one of the most highly recommended Python courses on YouTube is "Python for Everybody" by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). This course is praised for its thorough and accessible approach to teaching Python programming, catering to beginners and those looking to solidify their foundational knowledge. Spanning various essential topics, from variables and loops to data structures and accessing web data, Dr. Chuck's engaging teaching style and clear explanations make learning Python approachable and enjoyable. What sets this course apart is its connection to a broader educational context, with materials and assignments that are aligned with the "Python for Everybody" series available on Coursera and edX, offering learners a comprehensive and structured path to mastering Python.
