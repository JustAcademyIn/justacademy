Software testing is the process of evaluating a software program or system to identify bugs, errors, and defects. It involves running the software under various conditions and scenarios to ensure that it meets its requirements and performs as expected. The goal of testing is to find and fix any issues before the software is released to the public. The process of testing includes planning, designing test cases, executing them, and reporting and analyzing the results. Testing can be done manually or with the help of automated tools. It is a critical part of software development and helps ensure the quality, reliability, and effectiveness of the software. A comprehensive software testing course covers various techniques, methodologies, and tools used in software testing, including test design, test management, automation, performance testing, and security testing.
