A full stack mobile app developer is a professional who has the knowledge and skills to build complete mobile applications including the front-end, back-end, and database components. Offering a training program to students aiming to become full-stack mobile developers can be multi-faceted and comprehensive. Here are several points that could form the pillars of such a training program:

1) **Introduction to Mobile App Development**: Start with an overview of what mobile app development entails, including the types of mobile apps (native, web, hybrid), development platforms (iOS, Android), and current market trends.

2) **Programming Foundations**: Teach the essential programming languages and tools. For Android, this could be Java or Kotlin; for iOS, Swift or Objective-C. Introduce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web-based mobile apps.

3) **Front-End Development**: Focus on designing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of mobile apps. Include lessons on responsive design, front-end frameworks (like React Native for cross-platform development), and accessibility standards.

4) **Back-End Development**: Cover the server-side aspects, including database management, API development, and server scripting. Technologies might include Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Python with Django or Flask.

5) **Database Management**: Introduce various types of databases (SQL vs. NoSQL), and discuss how to create, update, and manage databases that store app data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.

6) **Version Control and Collaboration Tools**: Teach the importance of using version control systems like Git. Train students on collaboration tools such as GitHub or Bitbucket, which facilitate team-based projects.

7) **Cross-Platform Development**: Discuss the tools and frameworks that allow for development across multiple mobile platforms with a single codebase, such as Flutter and React Native.

8) **Mobile App Security**: Highlight the importance of security in mobile apps. Cover topics like secure coding practices, encryption, authentication, and data protection.

9) **Testing and Debugging**: Teach the techniques and tools for testing mobile apps, including unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests. Introduce debugging tools and strategies.

10) **App Deployment and Distribution**: Guide students through the process of preparing an app for deployment, including the steps to publish apps on platforms like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

11) **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Explain how to automate the building, testing, and deployment of mobile applications using CI/CD tools.

12) **Soft Skills**: Integrate training on communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability - essential skills for successfully working in technology projects.

13) **Project Work**: Assign real-world projects that require students to apply what they've learned in a practical setting, ideally culminating in a portfolio-worthy mobile app.

14) **Career Guidance and Industry Insight**: Provide sessions on building a career in mobile app development, including resume building, interview preparation, networking strategies, and insights into the latest industry trends.

Offering such a comprehensive training program can prepare students to enter the workforce as skilled full-stack mobile app developers, equipped with the technical know-how, practical experience, and soft skills necessary to succeed.
