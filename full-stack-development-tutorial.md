Full stack development involves the creation and management of both the front-end (user interface) and back-end (server, database, and application) components of a web application or site. A comprehensive full stack development tutorial typically covers a wide range of topics starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, moving on to back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, or Django depending on whether the stack is MEAN, MERN, or another. Additionally, it dives into database technologies like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, and might also explore RESTful API development, version control with Git, and deployment strategies using platforms like Heroku or AWS. Throughout the tutorial, learners would engage in hands-on projects to build their portfolio, gaining both theoretical knowledge and practical experience across the full spectrum of web development practices. This holistic approach ensures that by the end of the tutorial, learners are equipped with the skills needed to design, develop, and deploy full-fledged web applications.
