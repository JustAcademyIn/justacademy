##VB NET VS ASP NET

VB.Net and ASP.Net are both technologies developed by Microsoft for building web applications. VB.Net is a programming language that is used for developing Windows and web applications, while ASP.Net is a web framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications. VB.Net is used for coding the backend logic of an application, whereas ASP.Net is used for creating the user interface and handling requests from clients. Developers can use VB.Net to write code for the backend of an ASP.Net application, making them compatible and often used together in web development projects.
