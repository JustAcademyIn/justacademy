##DEVOPS VS SALESFORCE

DevOps is a set of practices focused on collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams to automate and streamline the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. On the other hand, Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage their sales, customer service, and marketing operations. While DevOps focuses on improving the software development and delivery process, Salesforce is a specific application platform tailored for managing customer relationships and business processes.
