PHP MySQL Web Development refers to the creation of dynamic and interactive websites by using the combination of PHP, a server-side scripting language, and MySQL, a relational database management system. PHP is utilized for writing scripts that are executed on a web server, enabling the functionality to generate dynamic page content, manage session tracking, and perform operations on a database, such as storing, retrieving, or updating data. MySQL, on the other hand, is used to store and manage the data that the website requires, such as user information, content, and settings. This powerful combination allows developers to create robust, scalable, and efficient web applications and websites that can handle complex tasks such as user authentication, content management systems, e-commerce sites, and much more. The wide support, extensive community, and rich set of features have made PHP and MySQL a popular choice for web developers aiming to build dynamic websites and web applications.

Sure, here's a detailed explanation of PHP MySQL Web Development for a training program aimed at students:

1) **Introduction to PHP and MySQL:** Outline the fundamentals of PHP (a server-side scripting language) and MySQL (a relational database management system). Emphasize how they work together to create dynamic web applications. 

2) **Setting up the Environment:** Guide students on installing a server (like XAMPP or WAMP) on their computers to practice PHP and MySQL. This includes configuring Apache, MySQL, and PHP on their development machine.

3) **PHP Basics:** Cover the syntax, operators, data types, and control structures of PHP. Introduce variables, constants, and arrays. Explain the importance of server-side scripting and how PHP fits into the web development landscape.

4) **Handling Forms with PHP:** Teach how to create HTML forms and process form data with PHP. This includes validating and sanitizing user input to ensure security and reliability.

5) **Introduction to MySQL:** Explain databases, how MySQL manages data, and its role in web applications. Cover basic SQL queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records.

6) **Integrating PHP and MySQL:** Demonstrate how to establish a connection between PHP and MySQL using PDO or MySQLi extensions. Guide them through creating a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

7) **Session Management and Cookies:** Introduce the concepts of sessions and cookies for maintaining state and tracking user activity across different pages of a website.

8) **File Handling and Uploads:** Teach how to handle file operations using PHP, including opening, reading, writing, and uploading files to a server.

9) **Security Practices:** Emphasize the importance of web security. Discuss common security threats (like SQL injection, XSS) and best practices to protect PHP/MySQL applications.

10) **Object-Oriented PHP (OOP):** Introduce object-oriented programming in PHP. Explain classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism and their benefits in web development.

11) **Advanced MySQL Techniques:** Cover advanced topics in MySQL, such as joins, indexes, and stored procedures to enhance database interactions and performance.

12) **Debugging and Testing:** Introduce tools and techniques for debugging PHP code and strategies for efficiently testing PHP and MySQL applications.

13) **Frameworks and CMS:** Brief on popular PHP frameworks (like Laravel, Symfony) and Content Management Systems (CMS like WordPress, Drupal) to speed up web development and introduce industry standards.

14) **AJAX and PHP:** Introduce AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to create asynchronous web applications. Teach how PHP can work with AJAX to make web applications more dynamic and responsive.

15) **RESTful APIs with PHP:** Teach how to build RESTful services with PHP. Explain how APIs work and how to handle JSON/XML for interchanging data between clients and servers.

16) **Deployment:** Guide students through deploying their PHP/MySQL applications on a server. Include domain registration, using FTP to transfer files, and configuring databases on a hosting environment.

17) **Project Work:** Encourage students to apply their learning by developing a complete web application incorporating PHP and MySQL. Provide project ideas that incorporate diverse features.

18) **Career Guidance and Further Learning:** Offer advice on building a portfolio, contributing to open-source projects, and continuing education paths in web development, such as learning additional languages or specializing in certain areas of web technology.

This comprehensive training program aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to embark on a career in web development, specifically focusing on PHP and MySQL technologies.
