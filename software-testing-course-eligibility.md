Software testing is a crucial aspect of software development as it helps ensure the quality and reliability of the software. Therefore, to become a software testing professional, one must possess a strong foundation in computer science and programming knowledge. Most software testing courses require candidates to have a technical background, preferably a degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field. However, some basic knowledge of programming languages and familiarity with software development processes can also make an individual eligible for a software testing course. As software testing involves critical thinking, good communication skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities, candidates with these qualities can also excel in this field.
