##Data Science VS DevOps

Data science and DevOps are two distinct disciplines in the field of technology. Data science focuses on extracting insights and knowledge from data using a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques. Its primary goal is to derive meaningful conclusions that help businesses make informed decisions. On the other hand, DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and automate the process of software delivery. DevOps aims to increase the speed, efficiency, and quality of delivering software applications, ultimately enhancing the overall software development lifecycle. While data science deals with analyzing data to uncover patterns and trends, DevOps focuses on improving the software development and deployment process through automation and collaboration.
