A Node.js stack is a collection of software tools and technologies that work together to build and run applications using the Node.js runtime environment. It includes packages, libraries, frameworks, and tools that provide essential functions such as server-side scripting, web server management, and database integration. The Node.js stack is highly efficient for building scalable, real-time, and data-intensive applications.

1) Node.js is a cross-platform open source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
2) It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient for handling large amounts of data.
3) Node.js stack consists of four main components: Node.js itself, a package manager (such as NPM), a web server (such as Express), and a database (such as MongoDB).
4) It is popular for building server-side applications, as well as creating APIs and real-time applications.
5) Node.js training programs offer hands-on learning to students on how to use this technology to create scalable and robust web applications. They cover topics such as server-side scripting, event-driven programming, and integration with databases.
