React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications with reusable components. React follows a component-based architecture, making it easy to organize and maintain code. It is known for its virtual DOM, which improves performance by efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the UI.

2) Angular:
Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework developed by Google. It provides a robust set of features for building single-page applications. Angular uses TypeScript for development, which offers enhanced tooling and type-checking capabilities. The framework emphasizes two-way data binding and dependency injection to enhance developer productivity and maintainability of code.

3) Vue:
Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its simplicity and versatility. It offers a flexible architecture that allows developers to incrementally adopt its features in existing projects. Vue provides a reactive and component-based approach to building user interfaces, making it easy to create interactive web applications. It is lightweight and has a gentle learning curve, making it a popular choice for beginners.
