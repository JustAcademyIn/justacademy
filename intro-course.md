An intro course, short for introductory course, is a type of class designed to provide a broad overview of a subject or topic. These courses are usually taken at the beginning of a college or university program and are meant to introduce students to the fundamental concepts, theories, and principles of the subject. They often cover a wide range of topics and serve as a foundation for more specialized courses in the future. Intro courses can vary in length and format, but they typically provide students with a basic understanding of the subject and help them determine if they want to pursue further study in that field.
