##Difference between MySQL and MariaDB

MySQL and MariaDB are both relational database management systems that are widely used in the industry. MySQL is an Oracle-owned database system, while MariaDB is an open-source fork of MySQL developed by the original creators of MySQL. Both databases share similarities in terms of features and functionality, as they were developed from the same codebase. However, MariaDB offers some additional features and improvements over MySQL, such as better performance optimization, more storage engines, and enhanced security features. Additionally, MariaDB has a more active open-source community that regularly updates and improves the database software.
