PHP Free Code Camp is an initiative or platform aimed at providing free, comprehensive learning resources for people interested in mastering PHP, which is a widely-used open-source general-purpose scripting language especially suited for web development. While Free Code Camp itself is primarily known for its extensive offerings in JavaScript, including frameworks and full-stack development, there isn't an officially dedicated track for PHP within Free Code Camp's curriculum. However, the ethos of Free Code Camp, which involves offering free coding education to anyone interested, has inspired numerous other online platforms, repositories, and community-driven projects to offer similar free resources for learning PHP. These PHP learning resources may include video tutorials, written guides, exercises, and projects that help learners grasp the basics and advanced aspects of PHP programming, enabling them to build dynamic websites and applications.
