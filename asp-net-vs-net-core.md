##Asp Net Vs Net Core

ASP.NET is a mature web application framework developed by Microsoft that initially ran on the .NET Framework. However, with the introduction of .NET Core, a modular and cross-platform version of the .NET framework, ASP.NET Core was developed as a part of it. ASP.NET is more feature-rich and has been around for longer, making it a solid choice for traditional web applications, while ASP.NET Core offers more flexibility, improved performance, and cross-platform support, making it a preferred option for modern and scalable web applications. Both frameworks have their own advantages and choosing between them depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project.
