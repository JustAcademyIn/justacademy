##DART vs FLUTTER

Dart is a programming language developed by Google that is used to write code for Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses Dart as its primary language, and it allows developers to create visually appealing, fast, and user-friendly applications with a rich set of widgets and tools. Dart is known for its simplicity, performance, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developing applications with Flutter across multiple platforms.
