Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing services over the internet. AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure (Microsoft Azure) are two of the most prominent cloud computing platforms. They offer a wide range of services like storage, networking, and computing power on a pay-per-use model. This eliminates the need for businesses to invest in expensive IT infrastructure and allows them to scale up or down their resources as per their needs. AWS and Azure also provide advanced features like data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, making it easier for businesses to innovate and stay competitive in the market.
