## PHP Crash Course

PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a popular and widely used server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. In a PHP crash course, you will learn the basics of PHP syntax, variables, data types, operators, control structures (such as if statements and loops), functions, and arrays. You will also be introduced to concepts like form handling, working with databases using SQL queries, and interacting with external files. By the end of a PHP crash course, you should be able to create dynamic web pages, handle user inputs, and interact with databases to build more interactive and dynamic websites.
