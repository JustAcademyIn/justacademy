1) **Introduction to PHP:** Many free PHP certification courses start with an introduction to PHP, covering its history, why it's popular for web development, and its role in the creation of dynamic web pages. This foundational knowledge is crucial for beginners to understand the scope of PHP applications.

2) **Basic Syntax and Operations:** In this section, students learn about PHP syntax, basic commands, variables, data types, and operators. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for writing any PHP code. Free courses often include exercises and quizzes to reinforce these basics.

3) **Control Structures:** Here, courses teach about conditional statements and loops in PHP. Control structures allow developers to dictate the flow of the program's execution, making the code dynamic and responsive to different conditions.

4) **Functions and Arrays:** Students learn to organize their code better and reuse code by creating functions. Additionally, they're introduced to arrays, which are fundamental for storing and manipulating collections of data. This section includes practical examples and coding challenges to solidify understanding.

5) **Form Handling and Validation:** This module covers creating web forms and securely processing user input using PHP. It's essential for interactive websites and involves learning about GET and POST methods, as well as validating and sanitizing input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

6) **File Handling:** Students are introduced to PHP's file handling capabilities, including reading from and writing to files. This part of the course may cover handling different file formats and using file system functions for managing directories and files, critical for content management systems.

7) **Database Interaction:** Most PHP certification courses teach how to interact with databases using PHP, with a focus on MySQL or MariaDB. This includes creating database connections, executing SQL queries, and handling data retrieved from a database. It's crucial for dynamic websites that store user data.

8) **Cookies and Sessions:** This section explains how to use cookies and sessions in PHP to store information about a user's interaction with a site. This concept is fundamental for creating personalized user experiences and managing user authentication.

9) **Object-Oriented PHP:** Many free courses introduce object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in PHP. This advanced topic covers creating classes, objects, properties, and methods. OOP helps in writing more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

10) **Security Practices:** Since security is paramount in web development, courses cover common security concerns in PHP applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and password hashing. Understanding these practices helps in developing secure web applications.

11) **Using PHP Frameworks:** Although not all free courses cover this, some introduce popular PHP frameworks like Laravel or Symfony. These frameworks speed up development and follow best practices, making complex applications more manageable.

12) **Final Project:** To culminate the learning experience, students typically complete a final project that incorporates everything they've learned. This project showcases their ability to create a dynamic web application and often serves as a portfolio piece.

13) **Certification Exam:** At the end of the course, students may have the opportunity to take an exam to earn certification. Although the course is free, some platforms might charge a fee for the certification itself. This certification can bolster a resume and prove proficiency in PHP.

14) **Continued Learning Resources:** Finally, good courses will provide resources for continued learning. PHP is a constantly evolving language, so it's vital to stay up-to-date with new features, best practices, and security updates.

These points highlight the structure and content you might find in a free PHP certification course aimed at offering a comprehensive training program to students.
