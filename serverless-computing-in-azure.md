##Serverless Computing In Azure

Serverless computing in Azure allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage or provision underlying infrastructure. With Azure Functions, developers can focus on writing code to handle specific tasks or events, while Azure takes care of scaling and managing the infrastructure needed to run the functions. This pay-as-you-go serverless platform enables rapid development, unmatched flexibility, and efficient resource utilization, making it an ideal choice for building event-driven applications and services in the cloud.
