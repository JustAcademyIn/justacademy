##ASP VS PHP

ASP and PHP are both server-side scripting languages commonly used for web development. ASP, or Active Server Pages, was created by Microsoft and is primarily used with Windows-based servers. PHP, on the other hand, is open-source and more platform-independent, running on various operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS. While both languages are capable of building dynamic websites and web applications, PHP is often favored for its ease of use, flexibility, and strong community support, making it a popular choice among developers.
