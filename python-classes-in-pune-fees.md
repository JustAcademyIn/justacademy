As of my last update in 2023, the fees for Python classes in Pune, India, can vary widely depending on the institute, course duration, and the curriculum's depth and breadth. Generally, short-term courses might cost from a few thousand rupees to more advanced and comprehensive courses ranging up to several tens of thousands of rupees. For example, a basic introductory course could be around INR 5,000 to INR 10,000, while more extensive programs offering advanced study and project work could go up to INR 20,000 to INR 50,000 or more. Some premier institutes and tech bootcamps may charge higher, factoring in their reputation, the expertise of the faculty, and the inclusion of career support services. It's important to evaluate the course content, the credibility of the training center, and reviews from past students before enrolling. Additionally, many online platforms also offer Python courses, sometimes at a fraction of the cost, which could be a viable and flexible alternative to consider.
