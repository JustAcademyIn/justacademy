1) Overview of Fullstack Development:
- This training program will begin by giving students an overview of the fullstack development process, including front-end and back-end technologies, databases, and web servers.
 
2) Front-end Technologies:
- Students will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the three fundamental languages used in building the front-end of a website. They will also learn popular front-end frameworks such as React or Angular for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

3) Back-end Technologies:
- Next, students will delve into the back-end technologies used to build the server-side of web applications. This can include programming languages like Python, Ruby, or Java, as well as frameworks like Node.js or Django.

4) Database Management:
- In order to store and manage data for a web application, students will also learn about database systems such as MySQL or MongoDB. They will learn how to design, create, and query a database, as well as how to integrate it with their back-end code.

5) Project-based Learning:
- Throughout the training program, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge through hands-on projects. This will allow them to gain practical experience and develop a portfolio of projects that demonstrate their skills to potential employers. They will also have access to resources and mentorship to help guide them through their projects.
