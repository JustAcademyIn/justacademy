As of my last update in April 2023, obtaining a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification entirely for free is highly unlikely due to the costs associated with the exam and preparation materials. The PMP certification, administered by the Project Management Institute (PMI), requires a combination of education and experience, along with passing a comprehensive exam. While there may not be a way to get PMP certified for free, candidates can reduce costs by accessing free study resources such as online tutorials, community study groups, or borrowing books from libraries. Additionally, some employers may offer to cover the costs associated with the PMP certification as part of professional development benefits. However, potential candidates should be wary of offers claiming completely free certification, as these may not be legitimate or officially recognized by PMI.

1) **Introduction to PMP Certification**: The Project Management Professional (PMP) certification is globally recognized and offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI). Itâ€™s designed for project managers to validate their skills and expertise in handling projects effectively. Getting the PMP certification typically involves passing a rigorous exam that tests a candidate's ability in directing project teams.

2) **Online Free Resources**: There are several websites and platforms that offer free resources such as study guides, practice exams, and introductory lessons specifically aimed at PMP certification preparation. These resources are beneficial for students who are self-motivated and can study independently.

3) **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)**: Platforms such as Coursera, edX, and FutureLearn offer courses related to project management and sometimes specifically for PMP prep. While the courses may be free, obtaining a certification of completion might require a fee. However, these MOOCs are an excellent way to gain in-depth knowledge from institutions and universities.

4) **PMI Membership Benefits**: Students who become PMI members receive discounts on their exam fees and gain access to a wide range of free resources including PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge). Membership also offers networking opportunities and access to member-only content.

5) **Local PMI Chapters and Study Groups**: Many local PMI chapters or study groups offer free workshops, seminars, and study sessions for PMP candidates. These are great opportunities to learn from certified professionals and to network with peers also preparing for the exam.

6) **Corporate Sponsorship**: Some companies offer to cover the cost of PMP certification as part of their professional development initiatives. This can include covering the cost of training programs, study materials, and the exam fee. Employees should check with their HR department about potential sponsorship opportunities.

7) **Project Management Blogs and Forums**: There are numerous blogs and forums dedicated to project management where professionals share valuable insights, study tips, and free resources. Some experienced professionals also offer mentorship or guidance to individuals preparing for the PMP exam.

8) **YouTube Channels and Podcasts**: There are specialists who have dedicated YouTube channels and podcasts to teaching project management skills and preparing for the PMP exam. These multimedia resources can offer a different approach to learning that might be more engaging for some students.

9) **Library and Academic Resources**: Students should not overlook the value of their local or university library. Many libraries offer access to books, e-books, and journals on project management and PMP certification studies. Librarians can help guide students towards useful resources.

10) **Government and Non-Profit Educational Programs**: In some regions, government or non-profit organizations offer free training programs aimed at professional development, including PMP certification. These programs might be tied to employment services or adult education initiatives.

11) **Social Media Groups and Pages**: There are several social media groups and pages dedicated to PMP certification where members share study materials, exam tips, and encouragement. It's a good way to stay motivated and get advice from those who have recently passed the exam.

12) **Alumni Networks**: Graduates should leverage their college or university alumni network as a source of information and possibly find mentors who can guide them through the certification process. Sometimes, alumni groups offer workshops or webinars on career development topics like PMP certification.

Each of these points presents a unique avenue for obtaining PMP certification training for free or at a reduced cost. Candidates should consider their learning styles, availability, and preferred study methods when choosing the resources that would be most beneficial for them.
