JSP (Java Server Pages) is a web technology that allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages. It combines the power of Java programming language with the ease of HTML. JSP pages are created as a combination of HTML, Java code, and JSP tags, which are special commands that can be used to access Java objects and perform various functions. These pages are then compiled and executed on the server side, and the resulting HTML is sent back to the client browser. JSPs are commonly used for developing web applications and provide a flexible alternative to traditional CGI scripts.

1) JSP stands for Java Server Pages and is a technology used for creating dynamic web pages. It is widely used in the development of web applications and websites.

2) JSP uses a combination of HTML and Java code to create web pages. This allows for the separation of presentation and business logic, making it easier to maintain and update the code.

3) JSPs are compiled into servlets, which are Java classes that can interact with the request and response objects of the web server. This allows JSPs to be executed on the server side, making them more efficient than client-side scripting languages.

4) JSPs can also include JavaBeans, which are reusable components that can be used to perform complex operations or calculations. This makes it easier to handle complex tasks and reduce the amount of code needed.

5) JSPs also support the use of standard and custom tags, which can be used to simplify common tasks and make the code more readable. This allows developers to focus on the logic of the application rather than the syntax of the code.
