##Advanced Java Sample Programs

Advanced Java primarily extends the standard Java (also known as Core Java) by introducing complex modules that enable web application development, network programming, server-side scripting, and database handling. Advanced Java sample programs often showcase techniques and functionalities like Servlet programming, JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaBeans, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and JavaServer Faces (JSF), among others. These sample programs serve as practical guides to understand and implement advanced concepts such as session management, socket programming, data encapsulation through beans, dynamic web content generation, and establishing database connections for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Through these examples, learners and developers can grasp how Java can be used to build scalable, secure, and efficient web applications and services.

Advanced Java is a step beyond the basics of Java programming, diving into more complex concepts, frameworks, and libraries that are used in developing sophisticated Java applications. Hereâ€™s a structured way you could offer a training program to students, focusing on sample programs that cover various aspects of Advanced Java:

1) **Servlets and JSPs**:
   - **Servlet Basics**: Start with explaining what servlets are, how they work, and their lifecycle methods. Implement a sample "Hello World" servlet that handles basic GET and POST requests.
   - **JSP Fundamentals**: Discuss JavaServer Pages (JSP), JSP scriptlets, declarations, and directives. Create a simple JSP page that displays current date and time.
   - **Session Management**: Create examples that illustrate session tracking mechanisms, including cookies, URL rewriting, and HttpSession.

2) **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**:
   - **Basic JDBC Program**: Demonstrate how to connect to a database, execute queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and display results.
   - **PreparedStatement & Transaction Management**: Showcase the use of PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection attacks, and how to manage transactions in Java with commit and rollback.

3) **Java Networking**:
   - **Socket Programming**: Develop a simple client-server application where a client sends a message to a server, and the server responds back.
   - **URL Processing**: Create a program that reads data from a URL using HttpURLConnection and displays the content on the console.

4) **Java Beans and EJB**:
   - **Java Beans**: Explain the concept of JavaBeans, properties, getters/setters, and create a basic Java Bean example.
   - **Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)**: Introduction to EJB types (Session Bean, Entity Bean), and creating a simple example using a stateless session bean.

5) **Java Messaging Service (JMS)**:
   - **Point-to-Point Messaging Example**: Design a basic application that sends and receives messages using a queue in JMS.
   - **Publish/Subscribe Messaging**: Implement a pub/sub messaging model using topics in JMS.

6) **Java Frameworks Overview**:
   - **Spring Framework Basics**: Introduce Spring's Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control. Develop a simple application that showcases Spring IoC container.
   - **Hibernate Framework Basics**: Educate on ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and create a sample Hibernate application that performs basic CRUD operations on a database.

7) **Web Services**:
   - **SOAP Web Services**: Create a simple SOAP-based web service that returns a welcome message.
   - **RESTful Web Services**: Implement a RESTful web service that performs CRUD operations using Spring Boot and JPA.

8) **Microservices with Spring Boot**:
   - **Creating a Simple Microservice**: Guide through creating a microservice for handling user-related operations (like registration and login) using Spring Boot.
   - **Inter-service Communication**: Demonstrate how microservices can communicate with each other using RestTemplate or FeignClient.

9) **Java Security**:
   - **Implementing Authentication**: Create a login form that authenticates users against a database using Java Servlets.
   - **Data Encryption**: Show how to encrypt and decrypt data in Java using AES or DES algorithms.

10) **Testing in Java**:
    - **JUnit Testing**: Introduce JUnit and create sample unit tests for a Java class.
    - **Mockito for Mocking**: Explain the concept of mocking in unit tests and demonstrate the use of Mockito.

Each of these topics requires a deep dive to provide students with a hands-on understanding of Java's advanced concepts. For a training program, mixing theoretical explanations with practical, hands-on sessions is crucial for effective learning. Providing real-world scenarios where these concepts are applied can greatly enhance the learning experience.
