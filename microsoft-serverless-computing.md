##Microsoft Serverless Computing

Microsoft Serverless Computing, also known as Azure Functions, is a cloud-based service that allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing servers. With Serverless Computing, developers can focus on writing code to execute specific functions or tasks, without the need to worry about infrastructure maintenance or management. Microsoft's Serverless Computing offering is scalable and cost-effective, as users only pay for the resources used during the execution of functions. This allows organizations to quickly develop and deploy applications, responding to events or triggers in real-time, without the overhead of managing and provisioning servers.
