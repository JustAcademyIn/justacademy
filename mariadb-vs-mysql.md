##MariaDB vs MySQL

MariaDB and MySQL are both open-source relational database management systems that are compatible with each other and share a common origin. MariaDB is a fork of MySQL created by the original developers after concerns about Oracle's acquisition of MySQL. MariaDB offers additional features, performance optimizations, and improved security compared to MySQL. While MySQL is still widely used and supported by Oracle, MariaDB is gaining popularity for its community-driven development and faster release cycle. Both databases are suitable for various applications, but the choice between them ultimately depends on specific user requirements and preferences.
