MERN stack is a popular software stack used for building dynamic web applications. It consists of four open-source components: MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing and managing data, ExpressJS is a backend framework for building web applications, React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a server-side platform for running JavaScript code. The combination of these technologies allows developers to build efficient and modern web applications with a seamless connection between the client-side and server-side, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
