A Laravel Beginner Course is designed to introduce newcomers to Laravel, a popular PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and robust tools for web development. The course usually starts by explaining the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and how Laravel implements it, followed by guiding students through the installation process, configuration, and setup of a Laravel environment. Students learn to build web applications by covering foundational topics such as routing, middleware, controllers, views, and interactions with databases using Eloquent ORM. Additionally, they explore Laravel's features for authentication, testing, and utilizing Composer for dependency management. By the end of the course, beginners are expected to have the skills to create simple to intermediate-level web applications using Laravel, understanding best practices and the importance of following secure coding standards. The course is typically structured with a mix of theoretical lessons, practical exercises, and a project that allows students to apply what they have learned in a real-world context.
