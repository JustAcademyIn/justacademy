JavaScript On Line refers to the writing and execution of JavaScript code directly within an HTML document, without the need for a separate external file. This allows for easier and faster development of dynamic and interactive web pages, as the JavaScript code can be easily incorporated and customized according to the specific needs of the page. JavaScript On Line is commonly used for tasks such as form validation, event handling, and creating visually appealing effects, making websites more user-friendly and engaging. However, it is important to use this approach judiciously and keep the code organized and efficient to avoid clutter and potential errors.
