## Mobile App Automation Testing

Mobile app automation testing involves using tools, frameworks, and scripts to automate the testing of mobile applications on various devices and operating systems. It helps in improving the efficiency and accuracy of testing processes by automating repetitive tasks such as regression testing, functional testing, and performance testing. Automation testing allows for faster test execution, broader test coverage, and early bug detection, resulting in higher quality mobile applications. Teams can save time and resources while ensuring a more robust and reliable mobile app before deployment to users.
