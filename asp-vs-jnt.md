##ASP vs JNT

ASPs (Application Service Providers) and JNTs (Joint Networking Teams) represent different approaches in the realm of information technology. ASPs offer software applications and services over the internet on a subscription or pay-per-use basis, providing users with access to technology without the need for significant infrastructure investment. On the other hand, JNTs are collaborative teams formed by multiple organizations to work together on networking-related issues or projects, pooling resources and expertise for more effective and efficient outcomes. While ASPs focus on delivering software solutions, JNTs emphasize teamwork and collaboration in networking initiatives.
