##Katalon vs Selenium

Katalon Studio is a comprehensive test automation tool that is built on top of the Selenium framework. It offers a user-friendly interface for teams with varying skill levels, making it easier to create, execute and manage automated tests. Katalon provides additional features like built-in keywords, object repository, and integration with popular CI/CD tools. On the other hand, Selenium is a widely-used open-source tool known for its flexibility and ability to work with multiple programming languages. It requires more technical expertise to utilize effectively but offers greater customization and control over test automation processes. Ultimately, the choice between Katalon and Selenium depends on the specific needs and skill set of the testing team.
