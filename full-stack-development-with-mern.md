Full stack development with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) refers to the development of applications that involve working on both the client and server sides of the web. It involves using technologies like React.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database. This allows developers to build efficient, scalable, and modern applications using a single language, JavaScript, for the entire development process. MERN stack development is popular for its fast-paced and versatile approach, making it an ideal choice for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
