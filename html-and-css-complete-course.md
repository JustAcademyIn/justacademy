HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are foundational technologies used to create and design web pages. An HTML and CSS complete course typically covers everything from the basics of HTML, which is used to structure content on the web, such as text, images, and links, to the advanced aspects of CSS, which is used to control the layout and appearance of web elements. Throughout such a course, learners would gain an understanding of how to write HTML code to create web pages, how to use CSS to style them, ensuring they are both visually appealing and functionally robust. The course would often include hands-on projects that enable students to apply their learning in real-world scenarios, building from simple web pages to more complex sites, incorporating responsive design principles to ensure sites work well across different devices. This comprehensive approach equips learners with the skills needed to start a career in web development or design.
