JavaScript Mean is a popular and widely used programming language that is primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. The term "mean" stands for "MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js" - these are the main technologies that are typically used together to create modern web applications. MongoDB is a database system used to store and retrieve data, Express.js is a web application framework, AngularJS is a front-end framework for creating single-page applications, and Node.js is a server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Together, these technologies provide developers with a powerful and efficient way to build dynamic web applications that can handle large amounts of data and provide a seamless user experience.
