## UX and UI Courses

UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) courses are designed to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to create seamless and visually appealing digital experiences for users. In a UX course, students learn how to research user needs, design user journeys, and create intuitive interfaces that enhance usability. On the other hand, a UI course focuses on teaching students how to implement design principles, use design tools, and create visually engaging layouts. By mastering both UX and UI skills, individuals can design interactive and user-friendly websites, apps, and products that meet the needs and expectations of users.
