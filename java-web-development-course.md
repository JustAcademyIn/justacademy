1) Fundamentals of Java: The Java Web Development course starts with teaching the basics of Java programming language. Students will learn about variables, data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. This will provide a strong foundation for building web applications using Java.

2) Web Development frameworks: The course will cover popular web development frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Struts. These frameworks provide a structured approach to building web applications, making development faster and more efficient. Students will learn how to use these frameworks to create scalable and maintainable web applications.

3) Front-end development: In addition to back-end development, the course will also cover front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students will learn how to create user-friendly and visually appealing web interfaces that interact with the back-end code.

4) Database integration: One of the key components of web development is integrating with databases. In this course, students will learn how to use SQL and other database technologies to manage and query data for their web applications.

5) Project-based learning: The Java Web Development course will feature hands-on, project-based learning where students will work on real-world web development projects. This will give them practical experience and prepare them for a career in web development. Additionally, the course may also offer internship opportunities or collaborations with industry partners to provide students with real-world experience and exposure.
