JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is commonly used in web development. It is mainly used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages, but it can also be used on the server-side to create web applications and mobile apps. JavaScript has a wide range of features, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and AJAX, which allows for asynchronous data retrieval without reloading the page. It is a versatile and powerful language that is constantly evolving and is widely supported by most modern web browsers.
