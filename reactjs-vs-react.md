##ReactJS vs React

ReactJS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, while React refers to the core concept of how the library works. ReactJS allows developers to create interactive user interfaces with reusable components, state management, and efficient DOM rendering. React emphasizes the principle of unidirectional data flow and the use of a virtual DOM to optimize performance. Both terms are often used interchangeably in the development community to refer to the library and its underlying concepts.
