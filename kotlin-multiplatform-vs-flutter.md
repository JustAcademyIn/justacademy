##Kotlin Multiplatform vs Flutter

Kotlin Multiplatform is a versatile cross-platform framework that allows developers to write code in Kotlin and share it across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and backend systems. It provides a more native experience on each platform and enables code sharing between different parts of an application. On the other hand, Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase using the Dart programming language. It provides a rich set of customizable widgets and a hot reload feature for quick development. Both Kotlin Multiplatform and Flutter offer unique strengths in cross-platform development, with Kotlin Multiplatform focusing more on code sharing and flexibility, while Flutter prioritizes fast development and consistent UI across platforms. Developers can choose between the two based on their project's specific requirements and preferences.
