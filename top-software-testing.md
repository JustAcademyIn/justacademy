Software testing is a critical process in the software development lifecycle, designed to evaluate the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of a product or application before it is released to the market. This process involves various techniques and methodologies, including manual testing, where testers manually execute test cases without the help of tools, and automated testing, which utilizes specialized tools to execute pre-scripted tests on a software application automatically. Key types of testing include unit testing, which assesses individual components for proper operation; integration testing, which examines the interactions between components; system testing, which evaluates the entire system's functionality; and acceptance testing, which ensures the software meets the end-users' requirements. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices integrate testing into the development process, enabling teams to identify and address issues early, improving software quality and delivery speed.
