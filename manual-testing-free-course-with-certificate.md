##Manual Testing Free Course With Certificate
Manual testing is a process in which software testers manually operate a system to identify bugs or errors, without the aid of automated testing tools. A free course on manual testing, culminating in a certificate, is designed to equip learners with foundational knowledge and practical skills in software quality assurance techniques. Such a course typically covers the basics of the testing lifecycle, including test planning, design, execution, defect tracking, and reporting. It aims at fostering an understanding of various testing types, like functional, integration, system, and user acceptance testing. The inclusion of real-world scenarios and hands-on exercises enhances learning, helping students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. Upon successful completion, the course often grants a certificate, acknowledging the learnerâ€™s proficiency in manual testing principles and techniques, bolstering their professional credentials in the field of software quality assurance.
