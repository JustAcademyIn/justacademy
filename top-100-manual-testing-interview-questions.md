1) What is manual testing? - Manual testing is the process of testing software manually by a quality assurance tester to ensure that the application functions as intended without the use of automation tools.

2) What are the different phases of manual testing? - The different phases of manual testing include test planning, test case development, test execution, defect reporting, and test closure.

3) What is the difference between verification and validation in software testing? - Verification involves checking whether the software conforms to its specifications, while validation ensures that the software meets the customer's requirements.

4) What is a test case? - A test case is a set of steps, conditions, and inputs used to conduct testing on a software application to verify its functionality.

5) What are the types of testing techniques used in manual testing? - Some of the testing techniques used in manual testing include black box testing, white box testing, functional testing, and regression testing.

6) What is the purpose of regression testing? - Regression testing is conducted to ensure that new code changes do not adversely impact the existing functionality of the software application.

7) How do you prioritize test cases for execution? - Test cases can be prioritized based on factors such as criticality of the functionality, risk assessment, and frequency of use by end users.

8) What is exploratory testing? - Exploratory testing is an ad-hoc approach to testing where testers explore the software without a predefined test script and use their expertise to uncover defects.

9) How do you handle a bug in a software application? - Bugs found during testing are reported in a defect tracking tool with detailed information such as steps to reproduce, severity, and priority for resolution.

10) What is the difference between smoke testing and sanity testing? - Smoke testing is conducted to check if the basic functionalities of the software are working, while sanity testing is performed to ensure that specific features are working correctly after changes.

11) How do you ensure that a software application is user-friendly during testing? - Usability testing is conducted to assess the ease of use, navigation, and overall user experience of the software application.

12) What are the characteristics of a good test engineer? - A good test engineer should have good analytical skills, attention to detail, communication skills, and the ability to work well in a team.

13) How do you handle a situation where requirements are unclear or incomplete? - Testers should collaborate with stakeholders to clarify requirements, document assumptions, and get approval before proceeding with testing.

14) What is negative testing? - Negative testing involves inputting invalid data or unexpected user actions to test how the software responds to error conditions.

15) What is usability testing? - Usability testing is a type of testing that evaluates how user-friendly a software application is by observing users interacting with the system.

16) How do you document test cases effectively? - Test cases should be documented clearly with steps to execute, expected results, actual results, and any deviations observed during testing.

17) What is boundary value analysis? - Boundary value analysis is a testing technique that focuses on testing boundaries or limits of input data to uncover defects at the edges of the software functionality.

18) How do you conduct compatibility testing? - Compatibility testing involves testing the software application on different platforms, browsers, and devices to ensure it functions correctly across various environments.

19) What is ad-hoc testing? - Ad-hoc testing is exploratory testing carried out without any predefined test cases or scripts, allowing testers to find defects based on their intuition and experience.

20) How do you ensure thorough test coverage in your testing approach? - Test coverage can be improved by designing test cases based on requirements, risk assessment, and using techniques such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis.
