Java Script, also known as JS, is a lightweight and interpreted programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is primarily used in web development to add client-side behavior to HTML pages. JS code can be embedded directly into HTML pages or can be in external files to be referenced by the HTML files. It is widely used for functions such as form validation, creating responsive designs, animations, and detecting user actions. It has a simple syntax and is compatible with all major web browsers, making it one of the most popular languages for front-end web development.
