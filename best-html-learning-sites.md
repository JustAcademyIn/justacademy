As of my last update in 2023, there are several standout platforms for learning HTML that cater to beginners and advanced learners alike. W3Schools remains a popular choice, offering comprehensive tutorials, examples, and interactive exercises that make HTML learning straightforward and practical. MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network) is highly regarded for its rich educational content and detailed documentation on HTML alongside other web technologies, ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding. Codecademy provides an interactive learning experience where users can write code and see the results in real-time, making it engaging for learners who prefer hands-on practice. FreeCodeCamp combines HTML lessons with projects, allowing learners to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios, improving both understanding and portfolio. Lastly, Coursera and Udacity offer courses created by universities and tech companies, blending HTML with broader web development skills; though some courses are paid, they're structured for a more comprehensive education. These sites, among others, have established themselves as excellent resources for anyone looking to learn or refine their HTML skills within a supportive, resource-rich online environment.
