1) **Introduction to Python**: This initial module would normally cover the basics of Python programming, including syntax, data types, and basic operations. Salem training centers would typically ensure that even absolute beginners can grasp the fundamentals.

2) **Environment Setup**: Students learn how to set up a Python development environment on their devices, whether it's installing Python directly or through an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Anaconda.

3) **Control Structures**: This part of the course emphasizes understanding of flow control mechanisms including loops (for, while), conditional statements (if-else), and exception handling, crucial for building complex Python scripts.

4) **Functions and Modules**: Learners are introduced to the concept of functions for code reuse and modularity, as well as how to organize, write, and import modules to enhance functionality.

5) **Data Structures**: Detailed exploration of Python's built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, enabling students to effectively manage and manipulate data.

6) **Object-Oriented Programming**: Covers the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, preparing students for more complex applications.

7) **File Handling**: Teaching file operations — reading from and writing to files — is essential for any program interacting with the file system, crucial for data processing tasks.

8) **Libraries and Frameworks**: Introduces popular Python libraries (like NumPy, Pandas for data science; Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization; and Flask, Django for web development) to broaden the application areas of Python.

9) **Project Work**: Real-world projects, often towards the end of the course, allowing students to apply what they've learned in a practical context, which is great for reinforcing concepts and skills.

10) **version control**: An introduction to version control systems, especially Git, for code management, collaboration, and deployment is becoming increasingly common in Python courses, preparing students for team-based and professional environments.

11) **Career Guidance**: Many training centers in Salem offer career counseling sessions, interview preparation, and resume-building workshops to help students leverage their new Python skills in the job market.

12) **Certification**: Upon course completion, students typically receive a certificate, which can be a valuable addition to their professional portfolio, especially for job seekers in the tech industry.

13) **Continuous Support**: Post-completion support in the form of doubt-clearing sessions, access to course materials, and community forums to help students stay on track and continue learning even after the course ends.

14) **Networking Opportunities**: Events, meetups, and seminars are often organized, allowing students to connect with professionals, mentors, and peers, thus enhancing their learning through community engagement.

These points illustrate a holistic Python training program that one might expect from a reputable training center in Salem. Each facility might offer variations on this template, but most will include these core components to ensure a comprehensive learning experience.
