JavaScript 101 is an introductory level programming language that is used for developing dynamic and interactive web applications. It is a client-side scripting language, which means it runs on the user's browser and enables the creation of dynamic web content such as animations, forms, and multimedia effects. JavaScript is also used for validating and manipulating data on web pages, making it an essential skill for front-end web developers. With its simple syntax and wide range of libraries and frameworks, JavaScript is widely used for creating modern and engaging websites. Learning JavaScript 101 is the first step towards understanding and creating powerful web applications.
