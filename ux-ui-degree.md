It combines principles of user experience (UX) design, which focuses on the overall feel of the product, and user interface (UI) design, which is concerned with the look and function of the product. Graduates with a UX/UI degree often work in industries such as technology, web design, app development, and e-commerce, creating visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that optimize user interactions and engagement.
