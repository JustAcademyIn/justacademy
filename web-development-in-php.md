## WEB DEVELOPMENT in PHP

Web development in PHP involves using PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) programming language to create dynamic web applications and websites. PHP is a server-side scripting language that works seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and database-driven websites. It allows developers to easily integrate with databases like MySQL, handle forms, manage cookies, interact with other servers, and do much more to create robust and feature-rich web applications. With a large built-in function library and active community support, PHP is a popular choice for web development due to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.
