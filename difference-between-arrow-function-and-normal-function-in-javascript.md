##Difference BETWEEN ARROW FUNCTION AND Normal FUNCTION IN Javascript

Arrow functions in JavaScript are a concise way to write functions, introduced in ES6, that provide some differences compared to normal functions. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings, which means they are bound to the enclosing functionâ€™s context. Arrow functions also do not have their own `prototype` property. This makes them particularly useful for shorter, more functional-style code. Additionally, arrow functions are unable to be used as constructor functions and cannot be called with the `new` keyword. They also cannot be hoisted like regular functions.

1) **Syntax**: 
   - Normal Function: Declared using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameters enclosed in parentheses.
   - Arrow Function: Declared using the arrow `=>` symbol after the parameters, with an implicit return if the function body is a single expression.

2) **this Keyword**:
   - Normal Function: `this` keyword refers to the object that called the function.
   - Arrow Function: `this` keyword refers to the value of `this` in the lexical scope where the function was defined.

3) **Binding of 'this'**:
   - Normal Function: Has its own `this` context which is dynamically scoped.
   - Arrow Function: Does not have its `this` context, it is bound to the parent scope where the function was created.

4) **Arguments Object**:
   - Normal Function: Has access to the `arguments` object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.
   - Arrow Function: Does not have its own `arguments` object.

5) **Prototypes**:
   - Normal Function: Can be used as constructors to create objects with prototypes and can be added new properties to the prototype.
   - Arrow Function: Cannot be used as constructors as they do not have their own `this` context.

6) **No New Keyword**:
   - Normal Function: Requires the `new` keyword to create new instances.
   - Arrow Function: Cannot be used with the `new` keyword.

7) **Function Body**:
   - Normal Function: Can have multiple statements within the function body.
   - Arrow Function: Can have only one expression in its function body which is implicitly returned without using the `return` keyword.

8) **Readability**:
   - Arrow functions are concise and easier to read, especially for simple functions.

9) **Lexical Scope**:
   - Arrow functions capture the `this` value of the surrounding code block at the time of their definition, whereas normal functions capture the `this` value at runtime.

10) **Use Cases**:
   - Arrow functions are commonly used for shorter, inline functions or when the `this` value needs to be preserved from the parent scope.

11) **Error Handling**:
   - Debugging arrow functions can be trickier compared to normal functions due to their implicit return and scoping differences.

12) **Compatibility**:
   - Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 and may not be supported in older browsers without transpilation.

13) **Performance**:
   - Arrow functions have slightly faster performance compared to normal functions due to their optimized syntax.

14) **Callback Functions**:
   - Arrow functions are often preferred for use as callback functions in array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

15) **Closure Behavior**:
   - Arrow functions do not create their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`, making them more suitable for certain closure use cases.

16) **Method Functions**:
   - When defining methods inside objects, arrow functions should be avoided as they do not have their `this` context pointing to the object itself.

17) **Named Function vs Anonymous Functions**:
   - Arrow functions are always anonymous and cannot be named, whereas normal functions can be both named and anonymous.

18) **Parameter Handling**:
   - Arrow functions have more concise parameter handling syntax, especially for single parameter functions.

19) **Logging**:
   - When logging functions to check their behavior, arrow functions might display differently due to their implicit return.

20) **Learning Curve**:
   - Understanding the differences between arrow functions and normal functions is crucial for JavaScript developers looking to write efficient and clean code. A training program covering these topics can help students grasp the nuances and best practices when using both types of functions in their code.
