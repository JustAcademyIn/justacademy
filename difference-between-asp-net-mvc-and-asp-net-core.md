##Difference between ASP NET MVC and ASP NET Core

ASP.NET MVC is a web framework developed by Microsoft that is part of the ASP.NET platform. It is based on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and is used to build dynamic web applications. On the other hand, ASP.NET Core is a new open-source, cross-platform framework that also implements the MVC pattern. The main difference between the two lies in their underlying architecture and features. ASP.NET Core is a more modern and lightweight framework that is designed to be more modular, flexible, and performant compared to ASP.NET MVC. Additionally, ASP.NET Core can run on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a more versatile choice for building web applications.

1) **Architecture**:
   - ASP.NET MVC: Based on the Model-View-Controller pattern, which separates concerns into three components: the model (data), the view (UI), and the controller (handles requests).
   - ASP.NET Core: Also uses the MVC pattern but is designed to be more modular and flexible compared to ASP.NET MVC.

2) **Platform Support**:
   - ASP.NET MVC: Runs on the .NET Framework and is primarily targeted towards Windows-based applications.
   - ASP.NET Core: Cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it more versatile for developing applications that can run on any operating system.

3) **Performance**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Generally offers better performance than ASP.NET MVC, with improvements in speed and efficiency due to optimizations and enhancements in the underlying framework.

4) **Dependency Injection**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Built-in support for dependency injection, making it easier to manage objects and dependencies within an application right out of the box.

5) **API Development**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Specifically designed to be a great framework for building APIs, with improved support for creating RESTful services, providing better tools for building web APIs.

6) **Tooling and Development Experience**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Offers improved tooling and a more streamlined development experience, with features like Razor Pages for simpler web app development and enhanced compatibility with modern front-end frameworks.

7) **Long-Term Support**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Microsoft has positioned ASP.NET Core as the future of .NET development, with ongoing updates and long-term support planned, making it a good choice for future-proofing applications.

8) **Open Source**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Built as an open-source framework, encouraging community contributions and providing transparency in development, which can be beneficial for students looking to engage with the technology ecosystem.

9) **Cross-Platform Debugger**:
   - ASP.NET Core: Offers a powerful cross-platform debugging experience, supporting debugging on Windows, macOS, and Linux, which can be advantageous for students working on diverse development environments.

10) **Container Support**:
