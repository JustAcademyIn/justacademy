React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is part of the modern web development stack, along with other technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. React utilizes a component-based architecture, making it easy to create reusable and maintainable code. It also offers a virtual DOM, efficient rendering, and a one-way data flow, providing developers with a more efficient and scalable solution for building dynamic, interactive, and high-performance applications. React is often used in conjunction with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux or React Native, to create powerful and feature-rich web and mobile applications.
