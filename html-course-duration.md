HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating websites and web applications. The duration of an HTML course typically varies from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the curriculum and course structure. Most HTML courses cover fundamental concepts such as document structure, text formatting, links, images, tables, forms, and basic website design. More advanced courses may also include topics such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), web development tools, responsive design, and multimedia integration. The duration of an HTML course can also be influenced by the mode of learning, such as in-person classes, online courses, or self-paced tutorials.
