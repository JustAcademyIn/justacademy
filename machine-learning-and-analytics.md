## Machine Learning and Analytics

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that information. Analytics, on the other hand, involves the process of analyzing data to discover meaningful patterns and insights, often using statistical techniques and software tools. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and analytics, organizations can derive valuable insights from their data to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and drive innovation.
