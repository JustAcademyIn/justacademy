As of my last update in early 2023, numerous platforms and educational websites offer free online courses in SAP ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), a high-level programming language created by SAP for developing applications on the SAP platform. These courses typically cater to both beginners and experienced programmers, covering topics from fundamental ABAP syntax and data types to more complex concepts such as BAPI, ALV reports, and dialog programming. Free courses are often delivered through video lectures, written tutorials, and hands-on exercises, allowing learners to gain practical experience. However, it's important to note that while the course content might be free, obtaining official certification usually requires a fee-paid examination through SAP. Websites like openSAP, Udemy, and Coursera occasionally offer courses at no cost or provide free trials, making them accessible resources for those looking to dive into SAP ABAP programming without a financial commitment.
