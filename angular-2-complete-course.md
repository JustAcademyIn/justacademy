Certainly! Below is a comprehensive outline for a training program on Angular 2, designed for students:

1) **Introduction to Angular 2**: This kickoff module introduces Angular 2, explaining its evolution from AngularJS and its significance in modern web app development. It covers the framework's philosophy, core concepts, and advantages over its predecessor.

2) **Setting Up the Angular 2 Development Environment**: This part guides students through setting up their development environment. It includes installing Node.js, the Angular CLI, and other essential tools needed to begin coding.

3) **TypeScript Overview**: Since Angular 2+ is built with TypeScript, a brief module on TypeScript syntax, features, and advantages offers a solid foundation. This includes types, interfaces, classes, and decorators that are pivotal in Angular 2 development.

4) **Components and Data Binding**: Students learn about Angular 2's building blocks - components, and how to bind data between a component's class and its template, enabling dynamic web applications.

5) **Directives and Pipes**: This module delves into Angular's directives for manipulating the DOM directly and pipes for transforming the displayed data in templates. Examples include built-in structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf, attribute directives, and creating custom pipes.

6) **Forms**: Covers handling user input with Angular forms, delineating between reactive and template-driven forms, form validation, and building complex forms that are scalable and maintainable.

7) **Routing and Navigation**: Students learn to add navigation capabilities to their Angular 2 app, understanding the Angular Router, configuring routes, router outlets, and parameters, and guarding routes for controlling access to certain parts of the application.

8) **Services and Dependency Injection**: This part explains creating reusable services and injecting them where needed using Angular's powerful DI system. It covers creating a service, registering it with an Angular module, and injecting it into components or other services.

9) **HTTP and Observables**: Students learn to make HTTP requests to communicate with remote servers for CRUD operations using Angular's HttpClient module. This includes understanding Observables from RxJS, handling async data, and error handling.

10) **Angular Modules and Best Practices**: Covers organizing code into modules, lazy loading modules for better performance, and adhering to Angular style guides for maintainability and scalability.

11) **Testing in Angular 2**: Introduces the concepts of unit testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing in Angular applications. It explains setting up testing environments, writing and running tests using Jasmine and the Angular testing utilities.

12) **Building and Deploying Angular 2 Applications**: Teaches how to use the Angular CLI for building a production-ready application, optimizing it for better performance, and deploying it to popular hosting services.

13) **Advanced Topics**: Depending on the course's length and the students' progress, this optional module could cover advanced topics like Angular Universal for server-side rendering, integrating Angular with other back-end technologies, and exploring the Angular ecosystem's newer developments.

14) **Final Project**: Students apply what theyâ€™ve learned to build a complete Angular 2 application, incorporating most, if not all, aspects covered in the program. This could be a real-world project or a series of smaller projects targeting specific Angular features.

15) **Wrap-up and Q&A Session**: Concludes the training with a session to review key concepts, address remaining questions, and discuss how to continue the learning journey in Angular and web development.

Each module is designed to be interactive, with theoretical lessons complemented by practical, hands-on coding exercises. The goal is for students to not only understand Angular 2 but also to be proficient in building applications with the framework by the end of the course.
