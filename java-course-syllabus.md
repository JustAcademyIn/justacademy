A Java course syllabus typically covers the fundamentals of programming such as variables, data types, operators, control structures, object-oriented programming concepts, and exceptions. It also includes topics on GUI programming, file I/O, networking, and databases. Students can expect to learn how to write and debug Java code, design and implement basic software applications, and understand the principles behind object-oriented programming. The course may also delve into advanced topics like multithreading, servlets, and mobile application development. By the end of the course, students should have a strong understanding of core Java concepts and be able to apply them to solve real-world problems.
