##Full Stack Web Development Program
A full stack web development program is a comprehensive educational pathway designed to equip learners with both front-end and back-end web development skills, enabling them to build complete web applications. Front-end development focuses on the client side, covering aspects like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server side, involving languages and technologies such as Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js, databases, and server architectures to manage data, server requests, and application logic. Through a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical projects, a full stack web development program aims to develop a well-rounded understanding of web development principles, tools, and best practices, preparing students to design, develop, and deploy end-to-end web solutions efficiently.
