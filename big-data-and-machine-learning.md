## BIG DATA and MACHINE LEARNING

Big data refers to large volumes of data that can be analyzed for insights and patterns. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. When combined, big data and machine learning can help in extracting valuable information from massive datasets, making predictions, and providing customized solutions. By utilizing machine learning algorithms on big data, organizations can uncover hidden trends, automate processes, and improve decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient operations and enhanced business outcomes.
