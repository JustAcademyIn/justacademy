## C++ for Machine Learning

C++ is a powerful programming language commonly used in machine learning due to its high efficiency and speed. It allows for low-level manipulation of memory and data structures, making it suitable for implementing complex algorithms and data processing tasks. C++ libraries such as Eigen and mlpack provide robust tools for machine learning, enabling developers to create scalable, high-performance models. While C++ may have a steeper learning curve compared to higher-level languages, its performance benefits make it a valuable choice for building advanced machine learning applications.
