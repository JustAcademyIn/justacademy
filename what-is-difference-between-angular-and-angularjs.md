##What Is Difference Between Angular And Angularjs

Angular and AngularJS are both front-end JavaScript frameworks developed by Google for building dynamic web applications. AngularJS, also known as Angular 1.x, uses JavaScript and follows the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture. On the other hand, Angular (versions 2 and above) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, utilizing TypeScript and following a component-based architecture. Angular offers better performance, improved code structure, and enhanced support for modern web development practices compared to AngularJS.

1) Angular:
Angular is a modern, open-source front-end web application framework maintained by Google. It is developed in TypeScript and offers a structured way to build dynamic web applications. Angular is known for its performance optimization, scalability, and dependency injection capabilities.

1) AngularJS:
AngularJS, also known as Angular 1, is the first version of the Angular framework released by Google. It is based on JavaScript and introduced concepts such as two-way data binding and directives to simplify web development. AngularJS has been widely used in the past but has now been largely replaced by Angular (versions 2 and above).

2) Language:
Angular is developed using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that enables stronger typing and additional features. On the other hand, AngularJS is based on standard JavaScript.

3) Architecture:
Angular follows a component-based architecture, where the application is divided into reusable and manageable components. AngularJS, on the other hand, is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

4) Performance:
Angular is designed to be faster and more lightweight compared to AngularJS. It uses a more efficient change detection mechanism and offers improved performance optimizations.

5) Dependency Injection:
Angular has an improved dependency injection mechanism, making it easier to inject dependencies into components and services. AngularJS also supports dependency injection but the implementation differs slightly.

6) Community Support:
Angular has a larger and more active community compared to AngularJS. This means that there is more documentation, tutorials, and support available for developers working with Angular.

7) Mobile Development:
Angular has better support for mobile development and is designed to work seamlessly across different platforms and devices. AngularJS may require additional plugins or workarounds for optimal mobile performance.

8) Tooling:
Angular comes with a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that streamlines the development process and provides features such as code generation, testing, and deployment. AngularJS does not have as robust tooling support.

9) TypeScript:
As mentioned earlier, Angular is built using TypeScript, which offers benefits such as static typing and improved code quality. AngularJS does not have native support for TypeScript.

10) Updates and Maintenance:
Angular receives regular updates and improvements, ensuring that developers have access to the latest features and performance enhancements. AngularJS has entered its LTS (Long-Term Support) phase and will no longer receive major updates or new features.

11) Learning Curve:
Angular has a steeper learning curve compared to AngularJS due to its more complex architecture and concepts. However, once developers are familiar with Angular, they can benefit from its advanced features and capabilities.

12) Future-proofing:
Choosing Angular for new projects ensures that developers are using a modern and supported framework that is likely to remain relevant in the future. AngularJS projects may require migration or updates to stay compatible with modern web development practices.

13) Support for Libraries and Tools:
Angular has better support for modern libraries and tools, such as Angular Material for UI components and RxJS for reactive programming. AngularJS may have limited compatibility with newer libraries and tools.

14) Testing:
Angular provides built-in support for testing using tools like Jasmine and Protractor, making it easier to write and execute tests. AngularJS also supports testing but may require additional setup and configuration.

15) SEO Optimization:
Angular has built-in capabilities for server-side rendering and improving SEO performance, making it easier for search engines to index and rank Angular applications. AngularJS may require additional techniques for SEO optimization.

16) Community Presence:
The Angular community is active, vibrant, and continuously contributing to the improvement and development of the framework, including bug fixes and feature enhancements. The AngularJS community, while still active, is not as prominent as the Angular community.

17) Deployment:
Angular applications can be easily deployed using tools like Angular CLI, which provides features for production builds, optimizations, and deployment strategies. AngularJS deployment may require more manual steps and optimizations.

18) Modularity:
Angular promotes modularity through features like Angular Modules, which help organize and encapsulate code efficiently. AngularJS also supports modularity but lacks some of the advanced features found in Angular.

19) Mobile App Development:
With the rise of mobile app development, Angular provides better support for building mobile applications using frameworks like NativeScript or Ionic. AngularJS may have limitations when it comes to mobile app development.

20) Performance Optimization:
Angular offers better performance optimization features, such as Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and tree shaking, which help reduce bundle sizes and improve loading times. AngularJS may require additional optimization techniques for optimal performance.

These points can be used to highlight the key differences between Angular and AngularJS when offering training programs to students. It is important for students to understand the unique features, advantages, and differences between the two frameworks to make informed decisions about their learning path and career development in web development.
