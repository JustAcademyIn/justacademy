Javascript Oop (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to create objects that have properties and methods, which can be used to perform various actions and manipulate data. It follows the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. This approach allows for more efficient and scalable development, as objects can be created and adapted to fit specific needs. With Javascript Oop, developers can create complex and dynamic applications by using objects and classes to represent real-world entities, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.

1) Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming. This concept involves creating objects that have properties and methods, allowing for easier organization and management of code.

2) Building and Using Objects: Students will learn how to create objects in JavaScript using the object literal notation, as well as using constructor and class methods. They will also gain an understanding of the concept of inheritance and how it works in JavaScript.

3) Encapsulation and Abstraction: OOP in JavaScript also involves the principles of encapsulation and abstraction, which allow for the hiding of implementation details and the creation of simpler and more maintainable code. Students will learn how to apply these principles in their code.

4) Understanding Prototypes: In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes. It is important for students to understand how prototypes work and how to use them effectively in their code.

5) Applying OOP in Real-World Scenarios: Throughout the training program, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge of OOP to real-world scenarios and projects. This will give them hands-on experience in utilizing OOP concepts and techniques in their own code.
