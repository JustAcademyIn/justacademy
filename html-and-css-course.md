HTML and CSS are essential languages for creating web pages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is used to structure the content of a webpage, while CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is used to style and format the visual appearance of a webpage. These languages are the building blocks of web development and are essential for creating responsive, user-friendly and visually appealing websites. In an HTML and CSS course, you will learn how to code these languages, create layouts, add images, videos, audio, and other multimedia elements, implement design principles, and make your webpage compatible with different browsers and devices. By mastering these languages, you will have the skills to create and customize your own website or landing page, and even pursue a career as a front-end web developer.
