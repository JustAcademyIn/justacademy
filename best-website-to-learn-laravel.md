As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, one of the best websites to learn Laravel, which is a robust and highly popular PHP framework for web development, is Laracasts. Created by Jeffrey Way, Laracasts is akin to a mix between a blog and a tutorial site that offers thousands of video tutorials on Laravel, PHP, and web development technologies. The website is renowned for its high-quality content that ranges from basic concepts to advanced techniques in Laravel development. The lessons are concise, up-to-date, and practical, providing an excellent learning experience for both beginners and experienced developers. Laracasts not only covers Laravel but also includes comprehensive lessons on modern PHP, web development practices, and front-end technologies, making it a holistic resource for developers looking to enhance their web development skills.
