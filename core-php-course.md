A Core PHP course is designed to introduce learners to the fundamentals and advanced concepts of PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. This course typically starts with the basics of PHP, teaching students how to set up a server environment, understand PHP syntax and variables, control structures (like loops and conditionals), and progresses to more advanced topics such as handling forms, using cookies and sessions for maintaining state, accessing and manipulating databases with PHP, often with MySQL, and securing PHP applications. Additionally, students learn about PHP's capabilities for handling file systems, generating PDFs, or creating images dynamically. The course aims to equip individuals with the skills necessary to build dynamic and interactive web sites and applications from scratch, emphasizing hands-on programming experience and real-world applications.

2) **Setting Up the Environment**: Students are guided through setting up their development environment. This includes installing PHP, a web server (like Apache or Nginx), and MySQL for database management. This foundational step is crucial for practical learning.

3) **Syntax and Basic Concepts**: This section introduces PHP syntax and the basic concepts of variables, data types, constants, and expressions. Students learn to write simple PHP scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming principles.

4) **Control Structures and Functions**: Students explore conditional statements, loops, and functions in PHP. They learn how to control the flow of their code and how to modularize their code using functions for better organization and reusability.

5) **Working with Forms and Inputs**: This module covers receiving and handling user inputs through forms, a common requirement in web development. It includes validating and sanitizing input data to enhance security.

6) **Database Integration**: Students are introduced to MySQL and learn how to integrate PHP with a database. This includes creating databases, using SQL queries to interact with the database, and performing operations like insert, update, delete, and select.
