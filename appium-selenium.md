## Appium Selenium

Appium is an open-source tool for automating mobile applications, and Selenium is a widely used automation tool for web applications. Appium Selenium is a combination of Appium and Selenium, allowing users to automate both mobile and web applications in a single test script. This reduces the effort required for testing across different platforms and provides a seamless experience for testers. By leveraging the capabilities of both tools, testers can easily create and run automated tests for mobile and web applications, saving time and improving overall test coverage and efficiency.
