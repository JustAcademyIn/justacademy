Javascript is a widely used programming language for creating interactive webpages and applications. It runs on the client-side, meaning it is executed by the user's web browser rather than a server. This allows for dynamic and responsive content on websites, such as animated graphics, form validations, and interactive maps. It is often used alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of a webpage. Javascript is also used to create web-based games, mobile applications, and server-side applications. Its popularity and versatility make it an essential language for web development.
