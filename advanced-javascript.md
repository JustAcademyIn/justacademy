1) Object-Oriented Programming: Advanced JavaScript training covers the use of objects, which are data structures that allow for the bundling of related properties and behaviors. Students will learn how to create and manipulate objects using the object-oriented programming paradigm.

2) Functional Programming: This training also includes the concepts of functional programming, which is an alternative approach to programming that emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems. Students will learn how to write and use higher-order functions, closures, and other functional programming techniques.

3) Asynchronous Programming: Advanced JavaScript training also covers asynchronous programming, which is the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without waiting for one task to finish before starting the next. This is particularly important for building modern web applications that require fast and efficient data processing.

4) ES6 and Beyond: The latest version of JavaScript, ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), introduced many new features and improvements to the language. Advanced JavaScript training will cover these new features, as well as newer versions of JavaScript, such as ES7 and ES8, which continue to add new functionality and improve the language.

5) Debugging and Troubleshooting: As students progress through the advanced JavaScript training program, they will learn how to efficiently debug and troubleshoot code. This is an essential skill for any developer, as it allows them to identify and fix errors and bugs in their code. Students will also learn best practices for organizing and optimizing their code to improve performance and maintainability.
