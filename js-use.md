JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level programming language that is used to add dynamic and interactive elements to web pages. It is a client-side language, meaning that it runs on the user's browser rather than on a remote server. JS is primarily used for creating responsive and engaging web interfaces, validating user input, and manipulating data on web pages. It is also commonly used in mobile app development, game development, and server-side programming. With its versatile features and widespread adoption, JavaScript has become an essential tool for web developers in creating modern and interactive websites.
