As of my last update in 2023, various online platforms offer PHP Free Certification Courses, designed to equip learners with comprehensive skills in PHP, a popular server-side scripting language used for web development. These courses often cover fundamental to advanced concepts, including PHP syntax, form handling, session management, and connecting PHP to a database. Aimed at beginners as well as experienced developers looking to enhance their skill set, these free courses typically provide an accessible pathway to certification upon completion. The certification, while not always recognized by traditional academic institutions, can nonetheless bolster a resume, demonstrate proficiency to employers, and provide a solid foundation for further web development learning and practice. Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy might offer these courses, sometimes free of charge with an option to purchase a certificate upon completion.
