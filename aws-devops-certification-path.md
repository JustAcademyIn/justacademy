Both certifications validate the holder's expertise in implementing and managing DevOps practices on the AWS platform. To achieve these certifications, candidates are required to have a strong understanding of AWS services, DevOps methodologies, monitoring, deployment automation, security best practices, and troubleshooting techniques.
