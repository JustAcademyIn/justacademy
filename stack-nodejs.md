##Stack Nodejs

Stack in Node.js refers to the combination of technologies used to build an application. A typical Node.js stack includes Node.js as the runtime environment, Express.js as the web application framework, MongoDB as the database, and Angular or React as the front-end framework. This stack allows for building full-stack web applications where Node.js serves as the backend technology, handling server-side logic and API endpoints, while the front-end framework enables the creation of interactive user interfaces. Additionally, MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is commonly used for data storage and retrieval. Overall, the Node.js stack provides a robust and scalable foundation for modern web development projects.
