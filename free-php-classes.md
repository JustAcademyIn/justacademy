6) **Advanced PHP Techniques**: Students explore advanced topics like object-oriented PHP (OOP), secure coding practices, and using PHP frameworks such as Laravel or Symfony. This prepares them for modern development environments and methodologies.

7) **Building a PHP Application**: In this hands-on project, students apply what they've learned to create a complete PHP application from scratch. This might be a blog, a small e-commerce site, or a personal portfolio, integrating front-end and back-end technologies.

8) **Testing and Debugging**: This segment covers the basics of testing PHP applications using tools like PHPUnit and techniques for debugging code. Students learn to write more reliable code and troubleshoot common PHP errors.

9) **API Integration and AJAX**: Here, students learn to enhance their applications with third-party APIs and asynchronous requests using AJAX. This class emphasizes creating seamless user experiences by fetching data without refreshing the web page.

10) **Deployment and Maintenance**: The final class teaches students how to deploy PHP applications to a server, covering domain registration, using FTP, and configuring database connections. It also touches on maintaining and updating live websites.

11) **Security Practices**: A dedicated session on security practices is crucial. It covers topics like preventing SQL injection, securing user data, and enforcing strong authentication measures. This ensures students are aware of potential vulnerabilities and know how to safeguard their applications.

12) **Open Source Contributions**: As an additional module, students might be encouraged to contribute to open-source PHP projects. This provides practical experience, introduces them to the PHP community, and teaches them about version control systems like Git.

Each of these classes can be offered as part of a comprehensive training program aimed at equipping students with the skills needed to become proficient PHP developers. Through a mix of theoretical learning and practical projects, students can build a strong foundation in PHP and related web technologies.
