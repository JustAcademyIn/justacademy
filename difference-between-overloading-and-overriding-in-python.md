##Difference Between Overloading and Overriding in Python

In Python, overloading and overriding are both ways to achieve polymorphism, allowing methods to behave differently based on the input parameters or object types. Overloading refers to defining multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters, allowing the method to perform different actions based on the number or types of arguments provided. Overriding, on the other hand, involves redefining a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass, allowing the subclass to provide its own implementation of the method. Overloading is resolved at compile-time based on the number and types of arguments, while overriding is resolved at runtime based on the object type.

1) Overloading and overriding are both concepts in object-oriented programming that involve methods in Python.
2) Overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name in a class but with different parameters or arguments. This allows a function to perform different tasks based on the input provided.
3) Overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a subclass redefines a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to provide a specific implementation for that method.
4) Overloading is achieved in Python by using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args), or variable-length keyword arguments (**kwargs).
5) Overriding is achieved in Python by defining a method in a subclass with the same name as a method in its superclass. The method in the subclass then replaces the method in the superclass.
6) Overloading is done at compile time, as the method to be executed is determined during the compilation phase based on the number and type of arguments passed.
7) Overriding is done at runtime, as the method to be executed is determined during the execution phase based on the instance of the class being referenced.
8) Overloading allows for a single method to have multiple implementations based on the parameters passed to it, providing flexibility and code reusability.
9) Overriding is used to provide specific implementations of methods in subclasses, allowing for customization of behavior without changing the superclass.
10) Overloading is a feature that is supported by the Python language and does not require any specific syntax to achieve.
11) Overriding is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming and is necessary for creating hierarchical relationships between classes.
12) Overloading is not common in Python due to its dynamic nature and support for default arguments and variable-length arguments.
13) Overriding is a common practice in Python when extending or customizing the behavior of classes from libraries or frameworks.
14) Overloading can make the code harder to read and maintain if used excessively, as it can lead to ambiguity in method resolution.
15) Overriding is a powerful tool for implementing polymorphism in Python, allowing different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.
16) Overloading can lead to method name ambiguity if not used judiciously, as multiple methods with the same name but different signatures may confuse developers.
17) Overriding helps in creating a more modular and extensible codebase by allowing subclasses to provide their own implementations of methods.
18) Overloading is more about providing different options for method calls, whereas overriding is about customizing behavior based on inheritance.
19) Overloading can be useful for implementing method variations like sum() for integers, strings, or lists, while overriding is typically used for specialization and customization.
20) Understanding the differences between overloading and overriding in Python is crucial for mastering object-oriented programming concepts and creating efficient and maintainable code.
