The HTML and CSS Full Course is designed to teach learners how to create and style web pages from scratch. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages, whereas CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout. This comprehensive course typically covers the basics of HTML, such as tags, attributes, and elements, progressing to more advanced concepts like forms, semantic HTML, and multimedia integration. On the CSS side, it begins with fundamentals like selectors, properties, and values, advancing to more complex topics such as the box model, flexbox, grid layouts, and responsive design principles. Through a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, learners develop the skills to build visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites. This course is ideal for beginners looking to enter the field of web development, as well as for professionals aiming to enhance their web design capabilities.
