Azure Durable Functions is a serverless computing solution offered by Microsoft Azure that allows developers to write long-running, stateful workflows in a simple and scalable manner. These workflows are composed of functions that are executed in response to events, allowing for the creation of complex and resilient applications. The Durable Functions framework provides developers with a high-level API and programming model in C# that makes it easy to orchestrate these workflows, handle failures, and monitor execution with built-in logging and tracking. This tutorial will guide you through the process of building and deploying durable functions using C# in Azure, giving you the tools to create robust and reliable workflows in your applications.
