As of my last update in early 2023, one of the most widely recommended Python courses for aspiring data analysts is the "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" available on Udemy. This comprehensive course is designed for both beginners and intermediate-level students who aim to master data analysis and visualization, machine learning, and data science using Python. It covers essential libraries and tools including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and many more. The course is taught by Jose Portilla, a well-regarded instructor in the data science community, known for his clear teaching style and in-depth coverage of material. What makes this course particularly attractive is its hands-on approach, featuring numerous projects and exercises that allow students to apply what they've learned to real-world datasets, thereby gaining practical experience that is crucial for a career in data analysis.
