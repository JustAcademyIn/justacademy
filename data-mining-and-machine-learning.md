## Data Mining and Machine Learning

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and relationships within large datasets to extract valuable information. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, involves developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Data mining often utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret complex data sets, allowing organizations to uncover insights and drive informed decision-making. By leveraging both data mining and machine learning, businesses can gain a competitive edge by identifying trends, predicting future outcomes, and optimizing processes.
