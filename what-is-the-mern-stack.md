##What Is The Mern Stack

The MERN stack is a popular development stack for building web applications, consisting of MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (a Node.js web application framework), React (a front-end JavaScript library), and Node.js (a run-time environment for executing JavaScript code). This stack is known for its flexibility, efficiency, and scalability, making it a preferred choice for developing full-stack web applications.
