1) Overview of AWS: The tutorial will begin with an overview of AWS (Amazon Web Services) and its cloud-based infrastructure services. This will cover topics such as computing, storage, and networking resources offered by AWS.

2) Understanding 3-tier architecture: The training program will then introduce the concept of 3-tier architecture, which is a common architecture for building scalable and secure web applications. This includes a presentation tier, application tier, and data tier.

3) Building the presentation tier: The first tier, presentation tier, is responsible for the user interface and is often built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tutorial will cover the basics of front-end development and how to use AWS services such as Amazon S3 for hosting static content.

4) Developing the application tier: The application tier is where the business logic of the web application resides. In this section, students will learn how to use AWS services such as Amazon EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing to build a highly available and scalable application tier.

5) Managing the data tier: The final tier is the data tier, where student will learn how to use AWS services like Amazon RDS and DynamoDB to store and manage data for their web applications. They will also learn about the principles of data security and how to implement them in the context of AWS.

By the end of this training program, students will have a solid understanding of AWS and the 3-tier architecture model, as well as practical experience in building a scalable and secure web application using AWS services.
