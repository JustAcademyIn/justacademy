Tree testing software is a tool used in the user experience (UX) research process to evaluate the hierarchy and structure of a website or application's information architecture. Essentially, it simulates the navigational environment without the visual design elements, allowing participants to complete tasks by clicking through text-based menus. This method helps identify where users encounter difficulties finding information or completing tasks, thereby providing insights into how the architecture can be improved for better usability. By stripping away the design elements, tree testing focuses solely on whether the information is organized logically and intuitively, making it a valuable tool for UX designers and information architects in optimizing the user journey through a website or application.
