## Hub Certification

Hub certification is a process by which companies are verified as being majority-owned, managed, and controlled by members of socially disadvantaged groups, including minorities, women, veterans, and individuals with disabilities. These certifications are typically used to qualify for government contracts and access resources to help grow and develop their businesses. Hub certification programs aim to promote diversity and inclusivity in federal contracting opportunities, creating a level playing field for historically underrepresented groups. By obtaining hub certification, businesses can enhance their competitive advantage, increase their visibility, and gain access to new business opportunities.
