Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) products are a set of cloud computing services that provide virtualized computing infrastructure resources to organizations. This includes storage, networking, and computing resources that can be easily provisioned and managed through Microsoft's Azure platform. These services allow organizations to build, manage, and deploy virtual machines and other infrastructure components on the cloud without the need to invest in physical hardware. With features such as scalability, high availability, and automated backups, Azure IAAS products offer organizations a cost-effective and efficient solution for their IT infrastructure needs.
