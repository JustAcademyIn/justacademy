##Different Types of Exceptions in Selenium

In Selenium, there are three main types of exceptions that can occur during test execution: WebDriverExceptions, ElementNotVisibleException, and NoSuchElementException. WebDriverExceptions are general exceptions that can occur due to issues like invalid elements, timeouts, or browser problems. ElementNotVisibleException is thrown when an element is found but is not visible or interactable on the page. NoSuchElementException occurs when an expected element is not found in the DOM, typically due to incorrect locator strategies. Handling these exceptions effectively through proper error handling techniques such as try-catch blocks or using explicit waits can help ensure smooth running of Selenium tests and accurate validation of web applications.
