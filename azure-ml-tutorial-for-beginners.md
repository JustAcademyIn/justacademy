Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based platform that enables users to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models. It provides a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop capabilities to create predictive models without any coding knowledge. This tutorial is designed for beginners to help them understand the basics of Azure ML and how to use it to develop and deploy machine learning models. It covers the fundamentals of data science, setting up an Azure ML workspace, creating and evaluating models, and deploying them for real-world applications. By the end of this tutorial, beginners will have the skills and knowledge to start using Azure ML for their own machine learning projects.
