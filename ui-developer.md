## UI Developer

A UI developer, also known as a front-end developer, is responsible for creating the visual elements that users interact with on a website or application. This involves coding using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring designs to life and ensure a seamless user experience. UI developers work closely with designers and back-end developers to ensure that the user interface is both functional and visually appealing, and they often need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in order to create modern and responsive interfaces.
