Java Full Stack development refers to the comprehensive approach of software development using Java technology, where a developer is proficient in handling both the front-end and back-end aspects of a web application. In Java Full Stack development, the front-end involves designing the user interface and client-side programming to facilitate user interaction, typically using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular or React. On the back-end side, it involves server-side development using Java and frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate to manage database operations, application logic, and server configuration. A Java Full Stack developer is skilled in using these technologies to build robust, scalable, and dynamic web applications from start to finish, covering every aspect of the development process.

1) **Introduction to Java Full Stack**: Java Full Stack development refers to the comprehensive approach of developing both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) portions of web applications using Java-related technologies. This offers a holistic training program covering every aspect required to build complete web applications. 

2) **Front-end Technologies**: Students will learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the cornerstone technologies for creating user interfaces. Frameworks like Angular or React that are often used in conjunction with Java backend will be introduced.

3) **Back-end Development**: This covers server-side development using Java. Students will delve into Java frameworks such as Spring Boot, which simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.

4) **Database Management**: Understanding how to interact with databases is crucial. Training will include working with relational databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and how to use Java to connect, interact, and manipulate data stored in these databases.

5) **API Development**: Students will learn how to create RESTful services and APIs using Java. This allows the front-end and back-end to communicate efficiently, passing data back and forth through JSON or XML.

6) **Version Control Systems**: Training on Git and GitHub will be provided to help students manage and collaborate on coding projects effectively. Understanding version control is crucial for working in professional development environments.

7) **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**: Knowledge on testing is vital. The training program will cover JUnit and Mockito for writing test cases, ensuring the application works as expected and helps in maintaining code quality.

8) **DevOps Fundamentals**: An introduction to DevOps practices will be included, helping students understand the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which are crucial for modern software development.

9) **Security Practices**: Security is pivotal. Students learn about secure coding practices, OAuth, and JWT for authentication and authorization, ensuring the applications they develop are secure from vulnerabilities.

10) **Soft Skills Training**: Besides technical skills, soft skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication are essential for a Full Stack developer. The program will include sessions to enhance these skills, preparing students for real-world scenarios.

11) **Project Work**: Implementing knowledge through project work is crucial. Students will get hands-on experience by working on real-life projects, applying all the skills learned throughout the course.

12) **Portfolio Development**: Guidance on building a professional portfolio will be offered, showcasing the projects worked on during the course. This is key for students when applying for jobs or internships.

13) **Career Services**: Support with resume writing, mock interviews, and job search strategies will be provided, helping students to navigate the job market effectively and land their first roles as Java Full Stack developers.

This comprehensive training program is designed to equip students with the necessary skills to become proficient Java Full Stack developers, ready to tackle real-world projects upon completion.
