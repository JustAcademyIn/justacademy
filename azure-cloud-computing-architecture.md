##Azure Cloud Computing Architecture

Azure Cloud Computing Architecture consists of four main components: cloud datacenters, networking infrastructure, virtual machines, and storage services. Cloud datacenters provide the physical infrastructure, such as servers and networking equipment, that host applications and store data. The networking infrastructure enables connectivity between different components and ensures secure communication. Virtual machines allow users to deploy and run applications in a flexible and scalable manner. Storage services provide options for storing and managing different types of data effectively. Together, these components form a robust and scalable architecture that allows businesses to leverage the power of the cloud for their computing needs.
