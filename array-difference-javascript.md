##ARRAY DIFFERENCE JAVASCRIPT

In JavaScript, array difference refers to finding and extracting values that are present in one array but missing in another. This can be achieved by comparing two arrays and filtering out the elements that are unique to one array. The resulting array will contain only the values that are not common to both arrays. Various methods can be used to calculate the array difference, such as using loops, array filter method, or the Set object. This operation is commonly used in scenarios where you need to compare, merge, or synchronize data between multiple arrays.
