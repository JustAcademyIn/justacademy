## Difference Between Photoshop and Corel DRAW

Photoshop is primarily a raster-based graphics editing software, commonly used for photo editing, image manipulation, and digital painting. On the other hand, Corel Draw is a vector-based graphic design software focused on creating illustrations, logos, and layouts using vector graphics. While Photoshop is more suited for working with photos and pixel-based images, Corel Draw is better for creating scalable vector graphics for print and web design.
