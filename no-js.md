No JS (JavaScript) is a programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive websites. It is a client-side language, meaning it runs on the user's browser rather than the web server, and is used for adding functionality, creating animations, and validating user input on a website. In recent years, the popularity of No JS frameworks such as Angular and React has increased as they make web development easier and more efficient. However, not all websites require JS, and some users may choose to disable it for security or privacy reasons.
