## Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Data analytics involves analyzing raw data to uncover insights and trends, which can then be used to make informed business decisions. Machine learning, a subset of data analytics, refers to the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming. By applying machine learning techniques to large datasets, businesses can achieve more accurate predictions and enhance their decision-making processes.
