##NEXT JS vs REACT JS

Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js, offering additional features like server rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing. While React.js is a library for building user interfaces, Next.js provides a more opinionated structure for developing web applications with React. Next.js simplifies tasks like server-side rendering and data fetching, making it a powerful tool for building sophisticated web applications with React.

1) **Next.js vs React.js Overview**

1) React.js is a JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces. It focuses on the view or UI layer of the application and provides components for building dynamic web applications.

2) Next.js is a framework built on top of React.js that provides additional features for building full-stack web applications. It offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and other capabilities for optimizing performance and SEO.

3) Next.js simplifies the setup and configuration needed for features like routing, data fetching, and code splitting, making it easier to build complex web applications.

4) React.js, on the other hand, is more lightweight and flexible, giving developers the freedom to choose the tools and libraries they need to build custom solutions.

5) React.js is more focused on the front-end development aspect, while Next.js includes features for server-side rendering and other backend functionalities, making it a more comprehensive solution for full-stack development.

6) Next.js is often preferred for projects that require SEO optimization, fast load times, and improved performance, while React.js is popular for smaller projects or applications that do not require server-side rendering.
