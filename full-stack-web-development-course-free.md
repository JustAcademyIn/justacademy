1) **Introduction to HTML and CSS**: This module is the cornerstone of full stack web development. Students will learn how to structure web pages using HTML and style them with CSS, which are the foundational technologies for creating web content.

2) **JavaScript Fundamentals**: A thorough understanding of JavaScript is crucial for full-stack development. This section covers basic to advanced JavaScript concepts, including ES6 features, to manipulate web page behavior and content dynamically.

3) **Version Control with Git**: Training in Git helps students manage their code versions and collaborate with others. The module includes creating repositories, branching, merging, and dealing with conflicts.

4) **Front-end Frameworks (React, Angular, or Vue)**: Students will learn one of the popular JavaScript frameworks or libraries for building dynamic and reactive web interfaces, understanding their core concepts, components, and state management.

5) **Backend Technologies**: This module covers backend development using Node.js and Express.js, teaching students how to create server-side applications, handle HTTP requests, and interact with databases.

6) **Database Management**: Students will explore both SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, learning how to design, query, and manipulate data, offering a comprehensive understanding of database technologies used in web development.

7) **RESTful Services and APIs**: Learning to create and consume RESTful services is essential. This portion covers developing APIs with REST for seamless communication between the client and server sides of an application.

8) **Authentication and Authorization**: This crucial section educates on implementing security features, such as user authentication and authorization, using technologies like OAuth and JWT to protect web applications from unauthorized access.

9) **Deployment and DevOps**: Students will learn about deploying web applications to cloud services (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and basic DevOps practices like continuous integration and delivery to streamline development and deployment processes.

10) **Build a Full-Stack Application**: As a capstone project, students will apply all the acquired skills to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack web application, combining both front-end and back-end technologies, to showcase their comprehensive understanding and proficiency.

11) **Soft Skills and Best Practices**: Beyond technical skills, this module emphasizes communication, teamwork, debugging, and problem-solving skills, as well as writing clean, maintainable code, which are crucial for succeeding in a real-world development environment.

12) **Ongoing Learning and Resources**: The last part of the course focuses on how to continue learning after the program, highlighting advanced topics, current trends in web development, and resources like documentation, forums, and online communities for continuous growth.

These comprehensive modules are designed to be accessible online for free as part of a full stack web development training program, promoting a self-paced learning environment that encourages hands-on experience through projects and real-world application development.
