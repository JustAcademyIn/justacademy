Core Java refers to the fundamental concepts and basic components of the Java programming language, such as syntax, data types, control structures, and object-oriented principles. Advanced Java, on the other hand, encompasses more specialized and complex concepts such as multithreading, networking, database connectivity, and graphical user interfaces. It builds upon the core concepts to create more robust and advanced applications. Together, Core and Advanced Java form a comprehensive knowledge base for developing a wide range of software solutions.
