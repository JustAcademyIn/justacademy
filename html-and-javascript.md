HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. On the other hand, JavaScript is a dynamic programming language used to make web pages interactive and responsive. It allows for the manipulation of HTML elements, creating animations, validating input forms, and performing calculations. Together, HTML and JavaScript work hand in hand to create engaging and dynamic web pages for users to interact with and access information on the internet.
