##Difference between CLOSE and QUIT in Selenium

In Selenium, the main difference between close() and quit() methods lies in their behavior towards the WebDriver instance. The close() method is used to close the current browser window or tab but leaves the underlying WebDriver instance running. On the other hand, the quit() method is used to exit the WebDriver session completely by closing all browser windows and ending the WebDriver process. If you only need to close the current window to continue interacting with the WebDriver instance, you can use the close() method. However, if you are done with the WebDriver session and want to clean up resources, you should use the quit() method to ensure all browser windows are closed and the WebDriver process is terminated.

1) Close in Selenium:
   - The close method in Selenium WebDriver is used to close the current browser window.

2) Quit in Selenium:
   - The quit method in Selenium WebDriver is used to close all browser windows associated with the WebDriver instance.

3) Close:
   - The close method is used to close the current browser window/tab only.
   - It does not terminate the WebDriver instance entirely.
   - It is often used for closing extra pop-up windows or tabs during a test.
   - The close method can be called multiple times during a test scenario to close different windows.

4) Quit:
   - The quit method is used to close all browser windows opened by the WebDriver instance.
   - It terminates the WebDriver session entirely.
   - It is recommended to use quit at the end of a test scenario to ensure all browser instances are closed properly.
   - Once quit is called, the WebDriver instance is no longer usable for further interactions.

5) Close:
   - Closing the browser using the close method leaves the WebDriver session open.
   - The resources associated with that session are not freed immediately.
   - It is useful when testing scenarios that involve multiple windows or tabs.

6) Quit:
   - Quitting the browser using the quit method releases all resources associated with the WebDriver session.
   - It is a more thorough way to end the testing session.
   - Using quit is considered a best practice to clean up resources and maintain the test environment.

7) Close:
   - The close method is a specific action that targets the current window of the WebDriver instance.
   - It is a lightweight operation compared to quit since it only affects the current window/tab.
   - It is ideal for scenarios where you want to close a specific window without affecting other open windows.

8) Quit:
   - The quit method is a broader action that closes all windows associated with the WebDriver instance.
   - It is a more comprehensive way to end the WebDriver session and release all allocated resources.
   - It ensures a clean exit from the test execution environment.

9) Close:
   - While using the close method, the WebDriver instance remains active for further operations.
   - It is suitable for scenarios where you may need to continue interacting with the WebDriver instance after closing a window.

10) Quit:
   - When using the quit method, the WebDriver instance is completely shut down.
   - It is recommended for ending the test session and releasing all resources used by the WebDriver.
   - Quitting the browser ensures a clean environment for subsequent test runs.

11) Close:
    - The close method is more focused on handling individual browser windows or tabs.
    - It is convenient for managing specific windows within a test scenario.

12) Quit:
    - The quit method is designed to gracefully shut down the entire WebDriver instance.
    - It is essential for proper cleanup and resource release after completing a test run.

13) Close:
    - Close is suitable for scenarios where you want to selectively close specific browser windows during a test.
    - It allows for more targeted window management within a test case.

14) Quit:
    - Quit should be used at the end of a test script to ensure all browser instances are closed properly.
    - It helps in maintaining a clean test environment and preventing resource leaks.

15) Close:
    - The close method offers a quick way to close the current browser window without terminating the entire WebDriver session.
    - It is efficient for handling temporary windows or pop-ups during testing.

16) Quit:
    - Quit provides a definitive way to end the WebDriver session by closing all associated browser windows.
    - It ensures proper cleanup and resource release after the test execution is complete.

17) Close:
    - When using the close method, the WebDriver instance remains active and can continue interacting with other open windows.
    - It is useful for managing multiple windows within a test scenario.

18) Quit:
    - Quit is the preferred method to end the WebDriver session and release all allocated resources.
    - It guarantees a complete shutdown of the WebDriver instance and all associated browser windows.

19) Close:
    - The close method is more specific and is used to target individual browser windows or tabs.
    - It offers a lightweight way to manage window closure within a WebDriver session.

20) Quit:
    - Quit method is the final step to close all browser windows and safely terminate the WebDriver instance.
    - It ensures proper cleanup and resource deallocation at the end of a test program.

These distinctions between close and quit in Selenium WebDriver are crucial for effective test automation implementation and resource management. Understanding when to use close and quit appropriately can help in maintaining a reliable and efficient test automation framework.
