React is a popular JavaScript library used for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web applications. It follows a component-based approach, breaking down a user interface into smaller, reusable components which are easy to maintain and test. React efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components, resulting in faster and more efficient web applications. It also provides a virtual DOM, making it easier to manage and update the state of the application. Additionally, React's popularity is attributed to its developer-friendly features and a thriving community, making it a preferred choice for creating modern and responsive web applications.
