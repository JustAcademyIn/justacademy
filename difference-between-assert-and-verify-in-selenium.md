##Difference Between Assert And Verify In Selenium

In Selenium, assert and verify are two commonly used commands for implementing validations in test scripts. The main difference between assert and verify is in how they handle failures. Assert commands are used to verify expected conditions, and if the assertion fails, the test script stops execution immediately and moves on to the next test case. On the other hand, verify commands also validate expected conditions, but if the verification fails, the test script continues with execution and reports the failure at the end of the test run. It is important to choose between assert and verify depending on the criticality of the validation in your test scenario and whether you want the script to continue executing despite encountering a failure.

1) Assert in Selenium:
Assert in Selenium is used to verify expected conditions by throwing an exception if the condition is not met. It is typically used for critical verifications that should stop the execution if failed.
Verify in Selenium:
Verify in Selenium is used to verify expected conditions without stopping the execution even if the condition is not met. It is commonly used for non-critical verifications that should not halt the test flow.

2) Assert:
- If the assert condition fails, it stops the execution of the current test method.
- It is primarily used for critical verifications where the test should not proceed if the condition is not met.
- Asserts help in identifying issues early in the test execution.

3) Verify:
- If the verify condition fails, the execution continues without stopping the test.
- It is used for non-critical verifications where the test can proceed even if the condition is not met.
- Verifies help in collecting multiple validation results without halting the test flow.

4) Assert:
- Asserts are best used to validate prerequisite conditions necessary for the test to continue.
- It aids in maintaining the test integrity by ensuring that essential conditions are met before proceeding further.
- Asserts are beneficial in preventing false positives by failing the test early on invalid conditions.

5) Verify:
- Verifies are suitable for validating optional elements or UI components that do not impact the test's main functionality.
- It allows the test to continue running, collecting multiple verification results along the way.
- Verifies are helpful in providing a comprehensive report of all validation points at the end of the test run.

6) Assert:
- Asserts are considered as hard assertions because they can stop the test execution abruptly upon failure.
- They play a crucial role in ensuring that critical checkpoints are validated before proceeding with subsequent test steps.
- Asserts are ideal for scenarios where immediate action is required upon validation failure.

7) Verify:
- Verifies are known as soft assertions since they do not halt the test execution on failure.
- They are useful for capturing multiple verification points without disrupting the test flow.
- Verifies are beneficial in scenarios where you want to collect validation results throughout the test run.

8) Assert:
- Example: Assert.assertEquals(expectedTitle, actualTitle);
- Example: Assert.assertTrue(element.isDisplayed());

9) Verify:
- Example: Verify.assertEquals(expectedText, actualText);
- Example: Verify.assertTrue(button.isEnabled());

10) Assert:
- Helps in ensuring the critical verifications are validated before proceeding further in the test.
- Plays a significant role in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of test results.
- Should be used when failure should stop the test execution.

11) Verify:
- Useful for validating non-critical verifications without halting the test flow.
- Enables collecting multiple validation results without interrupting the test execution.
- Should be used when the failure of a verification should not impact the entire test run.

12) Assert:
- Preferred for scenarios where stopping the test execution on failure is necessary.
- Useful in identifying issues early in the test run.
- Helps in maintaining the expected behavior of the application under test.

13) Verify:
- Suitable for scenarios where the test can continue running despite verification failures.
- Helpful in gathering comprehensive validation results throughout the test run.
- Supports in capturing optional verification points without affecting the test outcome.

14) Assert:
- Commonly used for critical checkpoints in the application flow.
- Helps in ensuring the core functionality of the application is working as expected.
- Should be strategically placed at key validation points in the test script.

15) Verify:
- Best suited for non-critical verifications like UI elements or optional functionalities.
- Allows the test to continue executing even if certain validations fail.
- Enables testers to collect a broader range of validation results without interrupting the test flow.

16) Assert:
- Requires handling exceptions for failures that need immediate attention.
- Ideally used for verifying conditions that are vital for the test scenario to proceed.
- Helps in maintaining the reliability and consistency of automated tests.

17) Verify:
- Doesnâ€™t require handling exceptions for failures, allowing the test to proceed smoothly.
- Suitable for verifying conditions that are not critical for the overall test scenario.
- Useful for capturing additional validation points without disrupting the test execution.

18) Assert:
- Can be implemented using TestNG assertions like assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.
- Ensures that critical verifications are checked before continuing with subsequent test steps.
- Facilitates early detection of anomalies in the application behavior.

19) Verify:
- Can be implemented using TestNG soft assertions to collect non-critical validation points.
- Enables continuous execution of the test script even if some verifications fail.
- Supports in creating a detailed validation report at the end of the test run.

20) Assert:
- Suitable for scenarios where failing to meet a verification condition could impact the overall test outcome.
- Helps in ensuring the expected state of the application before proceeding with the rest of the test script.
- Should be used judiciously to maintain the robustness of automated test cases.
