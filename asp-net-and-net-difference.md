ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft. It is used for building dynamic web applications, websites, and web services using languages like C#, VB.NET, and F#.

2) **.NET Framework**:
.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that primarily runs on Microsoft Windows. It provides a wide range of libraries and functionalities for developing various types of applications.

3) **Language Support**:
ASP.NET primarily supports programming languages like C# and VB.NET, while .NET has broader language support including C#, Visual Basic, F#, and more.

4) **Web Development**:
ASP.NET is specifically designed for web development, providing features like web forms, MVC, and Web API for building web applications. On the other hand, .NET is a general-purpose framework used for developing a wide range of applications.

5) **Cross-Platform Support**:
.NET Core, a cross-platform and open-source version of .NET, allows developers to build applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. ASP.NET Core is the web development framework that works with .NET Core.

6) **Compatibility**:
ASP.NET applications run on the ASP.NET runtime environment, while .NET applications can run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and different versions of the .NET framework.

7) **Development Tools**:
Both ASP.NET and .NET development can be done using Microsoft Visual Studio, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE).

8) **Security Features**:
Both ASP.NET and .NET provide built-in security features like authentication, authorization, and data protection, making it easier for developers to build secure applications.

9) **Scalability**:
Both ASP.NET and .NET support building scalable applications by providing features like caching, session management, and load balancing.
