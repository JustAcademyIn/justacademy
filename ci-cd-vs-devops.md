##CI CD vs DevOps

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) focuses on automation in the software development lifecycle for faster and more efficient delivery of software. It encompasses practices and tools that automate the building, testing, and deployment processes, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software releases frequently and consistently. On the other hand, DevOps is a cultural and organizational practice that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams to automate infrastructure, workflows and continuously deliver value to customers. While CI/CD is a set of practices and tools within the DevOps methodology, DevOps is a broader approach that involves cultural changes and collaboration across the entire organization to achieve seamless delivery of software.

1) Continuous Integration (CI): 
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. This helps to detect integration issues early in the development process.

2) Continuous Deployment (CD): 
Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Integration where the code changes that pass the automated tests are automatically deployed to production. This helps in delivering changes to customers quickly and efficiently.

3) DevOps: 
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. It aims to automate and streamline the software delivery process.

4) CI/CD Pipeline: 
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that code changes go through from development to deployment. It includes building the code, running tests, and deploying the changes to production.

5) Tools: 
Various tools like Jenkins, GitLab, Bitbucket, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible are commonly used for implementing CI/CD and DevOps practices.

6) Benefits of CI/CD: 
- Faster delivery of features and bug fixes
