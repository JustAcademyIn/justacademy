## GCP DevOps

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) DevOps is the practice of combining development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to speed up the software delivery process and improve the quality of applications deployed on Google Cloud Platform. It involves automating and streamlining the processes of building, testing, and deploying applications, using tools such as Google Cloud Build, Cloud Deployment Manager, and Kubernetes Engine. GCP DevOps practices enable teams to work collaboratively, make continuous improvements, and ensure that applications are secure, scalable, and reliable in a cloud environment.
