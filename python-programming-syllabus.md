##Python Programming Syllabus

The Python programming syllabus typically includes an introduction to programming concepts using Python, a versatile and widely-used high-level programming language. It starts with the basics of Python syntax, data types, and control structures (loops, conditionals, etc.), progressing to more complex topics such as functions, modules, and file handling. Advanced sections may cover object-oriented programming principles, exception handling, and data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets). Additionally, practical application through project work or case studies encapsulates handling databases, web development using frameworks like Flask or Django, and an introduction to data science and machine learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This comprehensive syllabus is designed to equip learners with a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work on real-world Python projects.
