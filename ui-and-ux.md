## UI and UX

User interface (UI) refers to the visual elements and design of a digital product, such as buttons, menus, and layouts, that users interact with. User experience (UX), on the other hand, focuses on the overall experience of the user when using a product, including factors like ease of use, efficiency, and satisfaction. While UI focuses on the aesthetics and visual aspects, UX delves deeper into the functionality and usability of a product to ensure a positive and seamless user experience. Both UI and UX are crucial in creating a successful and engaging digital product that meets the needs and expectations of users.
