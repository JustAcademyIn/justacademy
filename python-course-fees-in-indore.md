The fees for Python courses in Indore can vary significantly based on several factors, including the course's comprehensiveness, duration, the reputation of the institute, and the mode of instruction (online or offline). As of my last update in 2023, you can expect the fees to range from a few thousand INR for basic or short-term courses to over 20,000 INR for more advanced or lengthy programs offered by reputed training centers. Some premium institutions or courses that provide extensive hands-on learning, certification from recognized bodies, or personal mentorship might charge higher. Additionally, many institutes also offer flexible payment options, scholarships, or discounts, so it's advisable to research and inquire directly with the institutes for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the fees and what is included in the course package.

As of my last update in early 2023, specific course fees in Indore, India, for Python programming can vary widely depending on several factors, such as the course provider, the comprehensiveness of the curriculum, the mode of delivery (online or in-person), and additional resources or support provided. However, I can outline a general guide to the aspects that typically influence the fees for a Python training program offered to students in Indore. Please note, for the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's best to directly contact the educational institutions or training centers of interest. 

1) **Institution Reputation**: Courses offered by reputable institutions or renowned training centers may charge a premium due to their proven track record in delivering quality education and achieving high placement rates.

2) **Course Duration**: Longer courses that cover more material or provide more in-depth training typically cost more. Some courses are short and focused, while others may last several months or even a full semester.

3) **Certification**: If the course offers a recognized certification upon completion, fees might be higher. Certifications can add value to a student's professional profile.

4) **Mode of Delivery**: In-person training programs in Indore might cost more due to additional expenses like classroom space and equipment. Online courses can sometimes be less expensive as they do not incur these costs.

5) **Curriculum Depth**: Introductory courses that cover basic Python concepts will likely be less expensive than comprehensive programs that delve into advanced areas such as data science, machine learning, or web development with Django/Flask.

6) **Instructor Expertise**: Courses taught by highly experienced or industry-renowned instructors may command higher fees due to the expert knowledge and insights they bring to the program.

7) **Class Size**: Smaller class sizes offer more personalized attention but may increase the cost per student. Larger classes can sometimes reduce individual attention but might be more cost-effective.

8) **Added Resources**: Some courses might include additional resources like textbooks, course materials, software subscriptions, or access to cloud platforms, which can influence the overall cost.

9) **Post-Course Support**: Programs offering ongoing support, mentorship, or job placement assistance after course completion might be more expensive but provide greater value in the long run.

10) **Scholarships and Discounts**: Many institutions provide scholarships, early bird discounts, or financial assistance to students, which can significantly reduce the out-of-pocket expenses.

11) **Market Demand**: The current market demand for Python programmers can also affect course fees. High demand for Python skills might lead to higher course fees due to the increased value of acquiring such skills.

It's also worth mentioning that as of my last update, general Python programming courses in Indore could range from a few thousand INR for basic learning to tens of thousands of INR for comprehensive courses offered by top-tier institutes. For the most accurate pricing, prospective students should reach out directly to training centers or educational institutions for detailed fee structures and any financial aid options.
