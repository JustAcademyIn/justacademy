Mean in coding refers to the average value of a set of numbers or data points. It can be calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and dividing the sum by the total number of values. Mean is commonly used in coding to understand and analyze data, as it provides a central point of reference. It is also used for data normalization and to measure the performance of algorithms and programs. Mean is a useful and versatile statistical measure that helps programmers and data analysts make sense of large datasets and make informed decisions based on the data.
