##MySQL date between query

In MySQL, the `BETWEEN` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to specify a range that a value must fall within. When it comes to date values, you can use the `BETWEEN` operator to retrieve records where a date column falls within a specific range. For instance, you can construct a query like `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE date_column BETWEEN 'start_date' AND 'end_date';` The query above will return all records where the `date_column` value falls within the date range specified by `start_date` and `end_date`. It's important to note that the `BETWEEN` operator is inclusive, meaning it includes records where the date matches the `start_date` and `end_date`. Make sure to format the date values correctly in your query to ensure accurate results.
