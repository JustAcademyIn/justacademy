##Html Javascript

HTML and JavaScript are essential components of web development. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of a web page, organizing text, images, links, and other elements. On the other hand, JavaScript is a programming language that allows for interactivity on web pages, enabling features like dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and more. By combining HTML and JavaScript, developers can create rich and interactive web experiences for users, making the web more engaging and useful.
