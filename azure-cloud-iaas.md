##Azure Cloud IAAS

Azure Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft Azure that allows users to provision and manage virtual machines, storage, and networking resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. With Azure IaaS, users can create virtual machines running Windows or Linux, scale resources up or down based on demand, and benefit from high availability and security features. Azure IaaS also offers features such as backup and disaster recovery services, virtual networking, load balancing, and automation capabilities through tools like Azure Resource Manager. This allows organizations to quickly deploy and scale their infrastructure, reduce costs, and focus on their core business operations.
