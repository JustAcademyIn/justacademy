##Asp Net Core Vs Net Core

ASP.NET Core and .NET Core are both cross-platform open-source frameworks developed by Microsoft. .NET Core is a general-purpose, modular, cross-platform development platform for building different types of applications, while ASP.NET Core is a web framework built on top of .NET Core specifically designed for building web applications and services. ASP.NET Core includes features like MVC, middleware components, and a lightweight server implementation, making it well-suited for developing high-performance web applications. .NET Core, on the other hand, can be used for building a wide range of applications including web, desktop, mobile, cloud, and IoT applications.
