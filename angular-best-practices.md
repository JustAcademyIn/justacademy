Angular best practices refer to the recommended guidelines and techniques for building high-quality and maintainable Angular applications. These practices cover various aspects such as project structure, code organization, modular development, optimization, error handling, testing, and more. Following these practices can help developers avoid common pitfalls and create more efficient, scalable, and resilient Angular applications. Some best practices include using dependency injection, following the Single Responsibility Principle, using built-in Angular features instead of third-party libraries, and writing clean, readable, and testable code. Adhering to these practices can improve the overall quality and performance of an Angular application.

1) 1) Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Angular follows the concept of "One Component, One Responsibility", which means each component should have a single purpose. This helps in keeping the codebase clean and easily maintainable.

2) Use Angular Modules: Angular Modules help in organizing the code into smaller and reusable components. They also help in lazy loading, which improves the performance of the application.

3) Proper Directory Structure: Having a well-organized directory structure helps in finding and maintaining the code easily. It is recommended to follow the official Angular style guide for a consistent and standardized structure.

4) Use Observables for Data Manipulation: Angular is built on top of RxJS Observables, which offer a powerful way to manage data. Using observables for data manipulation can reduce the complexity of code and improve performance.

5) Follow Best Practices for Performance: Optimizing the performance of an Angular application is crucial for a smooth user experience. Techniques such as AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation, lazy loading, and minifying the code can help in improving the performance of the application.
