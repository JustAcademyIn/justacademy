##Difference Between C Java and Python In Tabular Form

Sure! Here is a comparison between C, Java, and Python in a tabular form:

| Feature       | C                                           | Java                                       | Python                                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Syntax        | Complex syntax, requires manual memory management                      | Intermediate syntax, automatic memory management through garbage collection | Simple syntax, easy to read and write, automatic memory management            |
| Performance   | High performance due to direct hardware access        | Slower performance due to virtual machine and bytecode execution      | Slower execution speed compared to C and Java, but faster development time due to simplicity |
| Platform      | Low portability, platform-dependent code               | High portability, platform-independent code                            | High portability, platform-independent code                                   |
| Usage         | Systems programming, embedded systems, performance-critical applications | Web development, enterprise applications, mobile app development   | Web development, data analysis, scripting, automation                |

In summary, C is ideal for systems programming and performance-critical applications, Java is commonly used for web development and enterprise applications, and Python is popular for web development, data analysis, scripting, and automation tasks due to its simplicity and ease of use.
