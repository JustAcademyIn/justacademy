##SQL DIFFERENCE

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a standardized language used to interact with databases. One key difference in SQL is the distinction between the SELECT statement and the WHERE clause. The SELECT statement is used to retrieve specific columns of data from a database table, while the WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on certain conditions. Combining the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause allows for more targeted and precise data retrieval, enabling users to extract the specific information they need from a database. This ability to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently is one of the primary reasons why SQL is widely used in managing and analyzing large datasets.

1) SQL vs NoSQL:
   - SQL databases are relational, meaning data is stored in tables with rows and columns, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, document stores, etc.

2) SQL vs PL/SQL:
   - SQL is a standard language used to manage and manipulate databases, while PL/SQL is a procedural language extension used in Oracle databases for writing stored procedures, functions, etc.

3) SQL vs MySQL:
   - SQL is the standard language for querying and managing databases, while MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that uses SQL as its querying language.

4) SQL vs SQLite:
   - SQL is a standard language for querying databases, while SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine that is often used in embedded systems or mobile applications.

5) SQL vs MongoDB:
   - SQL is a language used to manage relational databases, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

6) SQL vs PostgreSQL:
   - SQL is a language for querying and managing databases, while PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source object-relational database system that supports SQL along with additional features like user-defined functions, advanced indexing, etc.

7) SQL vs T-SQL:
   - SQL is a standard language for managing relational databases, while T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is Microsoft's proprietary extension to SQL used in SQL Server databases for additional functionalities like stored procedures, triggers, etc.

8) SQL vs Oracle SQL:
   - SQL is a standard language for managing databases, while Oracle SQL refers to the SQL dialect used specifically in Oracle Database management system.

9) SQL vs ANSI SQL:
   - SQL is the standard language for querying and managing databases, while ANSI SQL (American National Standards Institute SQL) is a set of standards that SQL implementations should adhere to for compatibility across different database systems.

10) SQL vs MariaDB:
   - SQL is a language used for querying and managing databases, while MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system and a drop-in replacement for MySQL that supports the SQL querying language.

11) SQL vs Microsoft SQL Server:
   - SQL is the standard querying language for databases, while Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft that uses the T-SQL dialect for querying and managing data.

12) SQL vs Transact-SQL:
    - SQL is a standard language for querying databases, while Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a proprietary extension to SQL used by Microsoft SQL Server for programming and managing databases.

13) SQL vs SQLite:
    - SQL is a language for querying relational databases, while SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine often used for local storage in applications.

14) SQL vs PostgreSQL:
    - SQL is a standard language for managing databases, while PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system that supports advanced features such as user-defined functions, triggers, and more.

15) SQL vs MySQL:
    - SQL is a language for querying and managing databases, while MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL as its querying language.

16) SQL vs Oracle PL/SQL:
    - SQL is a language used for managing databases, while PL/SQL is Oracle's procedural language extension for SQL used for developing stored procedures, functions, triggers, and more.

17) SQL vs NoSQL:
    - SQL databases are relational and use structured query language, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, document stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.

18) SQL vs MongoDB:
    - SQL is a language used to manage relational databases, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a flexible schema design with JSON-like documents.

19) SQL vs MariaDB:
    - SQL is a standard language for querying and managing databases, while MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system that aims to be fully compatible with MySQL and uses the SQL querying language.

20) SQL vs Amazon Redshift:
    - SQL is a language for querying databases, while Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that uses SQL as its querying language for analyzing large datasets.
