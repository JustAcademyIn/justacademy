JavaScript React is a popular open-source library used for building user interfaces in web applications. It is based on the concepts of component-based architecture, where different parts of the interface are broken down into small, reusable components. This allows for easier scalability, reusability, and maintainability of code. React also utilizes a virtual DOM, making it highly efficient and fast in generating dynamic user interfaces. It has gained a lot of popularity among developers due to its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive community support.
