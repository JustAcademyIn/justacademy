SetTimeout is a function in JavaScript that allows you to set a timer for a specified amount of time. This function takes in two parameters - a function or code that you want to execute after the specified time and the time in milliseconds. Once the timer is set, the specified code is executed after the specified time has passed. This is useful for delaying execution or creating a timed event in your code. SetTimeout is often used in conjunction with functions such as setInterval to create more complex timing operations in JavaScript.
