Short stack and full stack refer to the amount of chips a player has in a poker game. A short stack player has fewer chips compared to the starting stack, making them more vulnerable and forced to play more aggressively. In contrast, a full stack player has the maximum amount of chips and has more flexibility in their gameplay.
