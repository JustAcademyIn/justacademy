Javascript has evolved in recent years with new features and updates that make it more powerful and versatile. Some of the major changes include the introduction of ES6 syntax which allows for easier and more efficient coding, the addition of new data types such as symbols and modules, and the implementation of functional programming concepts. These advancements have made Javascript a more efficient and modern language, making it popular for both front-end and back-end development. Furthermore, the rise of frameworks and libraries such as React and Angular have made Javascript a leading language for building dynamic and interactive web applications. With its continuous development, Javascript is constantly improving and becoming a driving force in the world of web development.

1) Introduction to ES6: ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of Javascript. It introduces new syntax and features that offer improved readability and efficiency, making it essential for students to learn.

2) Arrow Functions: Arrow functions, also known as fat arrow functions, provide a shorter and more concise syntax for writing functions in Javascript. This can help students to write code more efficiently.

3) Modules: ES6 introduces the concept of modules, which allow developers to split their code into separate files and import them into their main file. This helps to organize code and makes it more maintainable.

4) Promises: Promises were introduced in ES6 as a way to handle asynchronous code. They offer a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server.

5) Classes: ES6 also introduces the class syntax, which provides a more familiar and easier way to create objects and implement inheritance in Javascript. It can help students understand object-oriented programming concepts better.
