Javascript and Java are two programming languages that are often confused due to their similar names, but they are actually quite different. Java is a compiled language used for creating applications and running them on a variety of platforms, while Javascript is an interpreted language primarily used for building interactive web pages. Java is considered a more complex and robust language, while Javascript is simpler and easier to learn. Despite these differences, both languages have their own strengths and are widely used by developers for different purposes.
