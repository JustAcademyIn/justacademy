##WordPress vs React

WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) used for creating websites with a user-friendly interface and a wide range of themes and plugins available. It is best suited for websites that primarily focus on content such as blogs or news sites. On the other hand, React is a JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces for web applications. It allows for the creation of dynamic and complex web applications that provide a seamless user experience. React is more suitable for applications that require high interactivity and real-time updates.
