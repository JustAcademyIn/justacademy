##ASP NET Core vs ASP NET MVC

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for developing web applications using C#. It provides improved performance, modularity, and flexibility compared to ASP.NET MVC, which is part of the ASP.NET web application framework and is tied to the Windows operating system. ASP.NET Core allows developers to build applications that can run on multiple platforms and environments, offering better support for cloud-based development and microservices architecture.

3) ASP.NET Core is open-source and has a modular architecture, allowing developers to choose and add only the necessary components, whereas ASP.NET MVC has a more monolithic architecture.
4) ASP.NET Core provides better performance and scalability compared to ASP.NET MVC due to improved request pipeline and performance optimizations.
5) ASP.NET Core supports modern programming features and practices such as dependency injection out of the box, which makes it easier to develop and maintain applications.
6) ASP.NET Core has a unified programming model that combines Web API, MVC, and signalR in a single framework, offering more flexibility for building web applications with different requirements.
7) ASP.NET Core is designed to work seamlessly with popular frontend frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js, making it easier to build modern single-page applications.
8) ASP.NET Core offers built-in support for containers and microservices architecture, enabling developers to create highly scalable and distributed applications.
9) ASP.NET Core has improved tooling and integration with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, providing a better development experience for programmers.
10) ASP.NET Core is optimized for cloud deployment and can easily be deployed to platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, allowing for easier scaling and management of web applications.
11) ASP.NET Core has better support for modern web standards and protocols, such as HTTP/2, WebSockets, and OAuth, which improves the overall security and performance of web applications.
12) ASP.NET Core enables developers to build and run applications on .NET Core, which is a lightweight and modular runtime that allows for faster application startup and lower memory consumption.
13) ASP.NET Core has a more flexible and extensible middleware pipeline, allowing developers to plug in custom middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, and authentication.
14) ASP.NET Core uses a new configuration system that is more flexible and allows developers to easily store application settings in various sources like JSON files, environment variables, or Azure Key Vault.
15) ASP.NET Core comes with a built-in health-check middleware that allows developers to monitor the health of their application and quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues.
16) ASP.NET Core has a built-in authentication and authorization system that supports various identity providers like Azure AD, Google, Facebook, and Twitter, making it easier to secure web applications.
17) ASP.NET Core has a built-in logging framework that supports various logging providers like console, debug, file, and Azure Application Insights, enabling developers to easily log and monitor application events.
18) ASP.NET Core supports automatic validation of API requests using data annotations and model binding, which simplifies input validation and error handling in web APIs.
19) ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for running unit tests using popular testing frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest, allowing developers to easily write and execute tests for their applications.
20) ASP.NET Core has a vibrant community and extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources available online, making it easy for students to learn and master the framework through training programs.
