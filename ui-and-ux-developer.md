## UI and UX Developer

A UI (User Interface) developer focuses on the visual presentation and interactive elements of a website or application, ultimately aiming to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience. On the other hand, a UX (User Experience) developer concentrates on the overall user journey and interactions within the interface, striving to optimize usability, accessibility, and efficiency for the end-user. Together, UI and UX developers collaborate to ensure that the digital product not only looks good but also provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for the users.
