1) DNS Basics: The Amazon Route 53 tutorial will start by covering the basics of DNS (Domain Name System) and how it works. This will include topics such as domain names, IP addresses, and how DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

2) Creating a hosted zone: The next step in the tutorial will be creating a hosted zone, which is a collection of DNS records that are managed by Route 53. This will involve setting up a domain name and configuring the necessary DNS records for that domain.

3) Managing DNS records: The tutorial will also cover how to manage DNS records in Route 53, such as creating, editing, and deleting records. This includes common record types such as A, CNAME, and MX records.

The tutorial will cover how to configure these policies and how they can help improve the performance and availability of your applications.

5) Advanced features: The final part of the tutorial will explore some of the more advanced features of Route 53, such as health checks, failover routing, and geo-routing. These features can be used to further improve the reliability and performance of your applications.
