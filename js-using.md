JS, short for JavaScript, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is commonly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it can be directly embedded into HTML code to make websites more interactive and responsive. JS can also be used outside of web development, such as creating mobile applications, server-side coding, and game development. With its wide range of applications and user-friendly syntax, JS has become a popular language among developers. It is supported by all modern web browsers and continues to evolve and adapt to new technologies and trends, making it an essential tool for creating engaging and dynamic web content.
