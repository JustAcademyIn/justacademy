HTML, standing for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages and applications. A basic HTML course typically introduces the foundational concepts and elements essential for web development, starting with the structure of an HTML document, including tags, attributes, and elements that define the content and layout of a web page. Learners will explore how to use tags to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, forms, and other key webpage components. Through practical exercises, participants will gain hands-on experience in writing HTML code, understanding its syntax, and applying best practices. The course aims to equip beginners with the necessary skills to start creating simple, effective websites and serves as a stepping stone to more advanced topics in web development, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.

Certainly! Here is an outline for a basic HTML training program designed to offer a comprehensive introduction to HTML for students. This structure is aimed at providing foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary for creating web pages.

1) **Introduction to HTML**: This initial module will cover the basics of HTML, including its role in web development, its history, and how it works with other web technologies like CSS and JavaScript. Students will learn about the structure of HTML documents and the concept of tags.

2) **Basic HTML Tags**: This part of the course introduces students to the most common and essential HTML tags used to structure web pages. This includes heading tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`), paragraph (`<p>`), break (`<br>`), and horizontal rule (`<hr>`) tags.

3) **Formatting Text**: Students will learn how to format text using HTML. This includes bold (`<strong>`), italic (`<em>`), superscript (`<sup>`), subscript (`<sub>`), and lists (ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>`). This module also covers how to create and customize lists and the importance of text semantic markup.

4) **Creating Links**: This module covers the creation of hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) within HTML documents, allowing navigation from one web page to another. It includes absolute and relative URLs, opening links in new tabs, and linking to specific parts of a page with anchor links.

5) **Inserting Images**: Students will learn how to embed images into their web pages using the `<img>` tag, including understanding attributes like `src`, `alt`, and dimensions. Best practices for image optimization and accessibility are also covered.

6) **Tables in HTML**: This part introduces the concept of creating and formatting tables in HTML using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` tags. Students learn how to structure data in tabular form, merge cells, and style tables for clarity.

7) **Forms and Input Elements**: Here, students will explore how to create forms using the `<form>` tag, learning about different input types (text, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.), the `<label>` tag for accessibility, and the basics of form validation.

8) **HTML5 Introduction**: An introduction to HTML5 and its new features, such as semantic elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.), new form types, and multimedia elements (`<video>` and `<audio>`). This module emphasizes the importance of semantic HTML and how it benefits accessibility and search engine optimization.

9) **Embedding Multimedia**: This module covers the inclusion of video and audio in web pages, using the `<video>` and `<audio>` tags, including the syntax for specifying multiple source files for compatibility.

10) **Building a Simple Web Page**: Combining all the skills learned, students will undertake a project to construct a simple but functional web page. This will include structuring the document, adding content, formatting text, inserting images, and linking between pages.

11) **Web Page Layouts with HTML**: Introduction to basic concepts of web page layout techniques using HTML. This includes understanding the role of CSS for styling, but emphasis will be on using HTML to structure content effectively.

12) **Best Practices in HTML**: This concluding module covers best practices for writing clean, efficient, and accessible HTML code. Topics include commenting, code indentation, using proper doctype, and validating HTML using the W3C validator.

Throughout the course, students will be given practical exercises to reinforce what they've learned and gradually build their skills. By the end, they should be able to create basic web pages and have a solid foundation for further study in web development.
