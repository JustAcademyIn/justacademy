1) **Introduction to Basics:** This section of the PHP online course covers the fundamental concepts of PHP programming. It's designed to offer students a strong foundation, starting with syntax, data types, variables, and basic operations. This introductory module ensures even complete beginners can get started with PHP.

2) **Control Structures and Functions:** Students will learn how to control the flow of their code using if-else conditions, loops (for, while, and do-while), and switches. This module also introduces the creation and usage of functions in PHP for modular programming, which is vital for writing clean and maintainable code.

3) **Working with Forms and Data:** This part of the course guides students through handling user inputs via forms, performing data validation, and processing form data securely. It is crucial for creating interactive web applications that can collect information from users.

4) **Database Interaction:** PHP's ability to interact with databases is one of its most powerful features. This module teaches students how to use PHP to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases, with a focus on MySQL, preparing them for dynamic website development.

5) **Sessions and Cookies:** Students learn to manage sessions and cookies for tracking user activities and preferences across multiple pages, which is essential for creating personalized user experiences on websites.

6) **File Handling:** The course covers how to open, read, write, and close files on the server using PHP. This knowledge is crucial for web applications that need to generate, store, or process files.

7) **Security Best Practices:** This critical module focuses on securing PHP applications by teaching students about common security threats like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It educates students on writing secure code and implementing best practices to protect web applications.

8) **Using PHP Frameworks:** An introduction to popular PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter. This section explains the benefits of using frameworks, such as speeding up the development process, and provides a basic overview of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

9) **Building a Web Application:** As a capstone project, students apply what they've learned to build a complete web application. This project-based learning consolidates their knowledge and skills in a practical setting, demonstrating how different pieces of the PHP puzzle fit together.

10) **Deployment and Going Live:** Students learn about the steps required to move a web application from development to production. This includes using FTP to upload files to a server, setting up domain names, and understanding basic server configuration.

11) **Continued Learning and Resources:** The course concludes by providing students with resources for further learning. This includes PHP documentation, community forums, and advanced topics like building RESTful APIs and using PHP with cloud services.

Each module of the free PHP online course is designed with interactive components such as quizzes, coding exercises, and assignments to help students actively engage with the material and build their PHP programming skills progressively. By offering the course for free, it aims to make learning accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation, and inspire more individuals to start their journey in web development.
