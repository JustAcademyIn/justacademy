##Difference between React JS and React Native

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications, while React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using React. React JS is used for developing web applications that run in the browser, while React Native allows developers to build mobile applications that can run on both iOS and Android platforms. The key difference is that React JS produces web components, while React Native generates native components for mobile development, making it easier to create mobile apps with a look and feel native to each platform.

1) React JS is a JavaScript library mainly used for building user interfaces for web applications, while React Native is a framework used for developing mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms using JavaScript and React.
2) React JS applications run in the browser, whereas React Native applications run on actual mobile devices.
3) React JS uses DOM elements for rendering UI components, whereas React Native uses native components provided by the platform.
4) React JS is more suitable for web development projects, while React Native is more suited for mobile app development.
5) React JS is based on virtual DOM for optimizing performance, while React Native uses native APIs for better performance on mobile devices.
6) React JS developers need to have a good understanding of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while React Native developers need to be familiar with mobile app development concepts.
7) React JS applications are responsive by default for various screen sizes, while React Native apps need to be optimized for different mobile devices.
8) Hot reloading is more commonly used in React Native for quickly seeing changes during development, while React JS developers might need to manually refresh the browser.
9) React JS has a wider range of third-party libraries and packages available compared to React Native.
10) React JS components are reusable across different web pages, while React Native components are specific to mobile app development.
11) React JS projects can be easily integrated with various backend technologies and APIs for web applications, while React Native focuses on mobile-specific integrations.
12) React JS developers can utilize browser developer tools for debugging, while React Native developers often rely on platform-specific tools for debugging mobile apps.
13) React JS projects can be hosted on any web server, while React Native apps need to be distributed through app stores for iOS and Android.
14) React JS allows for traditional web development concepts like SEO optimization, which are not as relevant for React Native mobile apps.
15) React JS projects often require knowledge of state management libraries like Redux or Context API, while React Native has its own state management solutions like Redux or MobX.
16) React JS developers may need to consider browser compatibility when building web applications, while React Native developers focus on platform-specific features and APIs.
17) React JS updates are handled differently compared to React Native updates due to the nature of the platforms they target.
18) React JS developers can leverage responsive design techniques for web applications, while React Native developers must consider mobile device constraints and interactions.
19) React JS projects typically involve working with CSS for styling, while React Native uses its own styling system based on JavaScript objects.
20) React JS developers may need to consider accessibility features for web applications, while React Native developers focus on mobile accessibility standards and guidelines.

This overview of the differences between React JS and React Native can help students understand the unique features and considerations when choosing to specialize in web development with React JS or mobile app development with React Native. A comprehensive training program covering both technologies can provide students with versatile skills to pursue a career in frontend development across web and mobile platforms.
