Core Java is the fundamental language that provides the basic building blocks for creating software applications. It includes the core concepts of programming such as data types, variables, control structures, and object-oriented programming. On the other hand, Advanced Java builds upon Core Java to provide more complex and sophisticated features and tools for developing robust and scalable applications. It includes technologies such as servlets, JSP, JDBC, and frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, which are used for web development and database connectivity. Together, Core Java and Advanced Java form a powerful combination that allows developers to create a wide range of applications for different platforms and industries.
