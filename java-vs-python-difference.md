##Java vs Python Difference

Java and Python are both popular programming languages, but they have some key differences. Java is a statically typed language, which means variable types are known at compile time and must be explicitly declared, while Python is a dynamically typed language that infers variable types at runtime. Java is traditionally used for large-scale enterprise applications and Android app development, with a strong focus on performance and scalability. Python, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a great choice for beginners and rapid development. Python also has a vast range of libraries and frameworks for various purposes, including web development, data science, and machine learning. Overall, the choice between Java and Python usually depends on the specific project requirements, performance needs, and personal preference of the developer.
