1) **Introduction to ABAP:** This fundamental point offers a comprehensive overview of ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), which is the primary programming language used for customizing SAP applications. The training program will introduce the students to the basics of ABAP, including its syntax, structure, and key functionalities.

2) **Data Types and Data Objects:** Students will learn about the various data types in ABAP, how to define and use data objects, and the operations that can be performed with them. This knowledge is crucial for creating efficient and effective programming solutions within the SAP environment.

3) **Control Structures and Modularization Techniques:** This module covers the essential control structures in ABAP such as loops, conditional statements, and selection screens, along with modularization techniques like subroutines, function modules, and classes. It trains students to write more organized and reusable code.

4) **Database Access:** Students will gain expertise in accessing and manipulating database tables specific to SAP systems using Open SQL and Native SQL commands. This includes understanding the reading, writing, updating, and deletion operations that are central to working with SAP data.

5) **SAP Data Dictionary:** The course will cover the SAP Data Dictionary, which is a central repository for data used in all ABAP applications. Students will learn about creating and managing database objects like tables, views, indexes, and others within the SAP environment.

6) **ABAP Reports:** Participants will be introduced to creating classical and interactive reports in ABAP. This section teaches how to develop lists and form-based outputs which are a significant part of SAP applications for end-user reporting.

7) **Dialog Programming (Transactions):** This area focuses on teaching students how to create transactional screens and manage user inputs. It covers screen navigation, table controls, and menu bars which are essential for creating user-friendly interfaces within SAP systems.

8) **Enhancements and Modifications:** Students will learn about the various enhancement options available in SAP, such as User Exits, BADI (Business Add-Ins), and Enhancement Points. This knowledge enables participants to extend and customize standard SAP functionality without affecting the core system.

9) **ABAP Objects (Object-Oriented Programming):** The course includes a detailed look into object-oriented programming principles within the context of ABAP. This module prepares students to work with classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces - essential for developing complex applications within the SAP framework.

10) **Web Dynpro for ABAP:** Participants are introduced to Web Dynpro, SAP's standard UI technology for developing web applications in ABAP. This part covers the architecture, key concepts, and development tools for creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.

11) **Floorplan Manager (FPM) for Web Dynpro ABAP:** This advanced topic discusses the Floorplan Manager, a configurable user interface framework for Web Dynpro ABAP. It enables the design and use of application-specific floorplans and UIBBs (User Interface Building Blocks).

12) **Integration Technologies:** Students will explore how ABAP integrates with other SAP and non-SAP applications using technologies like RFCs (Remote Function Calls), IDocs (Intermediate Documents), Web Services, and OData services. This equips them to work on scenarios that require data exchange between systems.

13) **ABAP Workbench Tools:** An introduction to the ABAP Workbench, a suite of tools used for development activities in SAP. This covers the ABAP Editor, ABAP Debugger, and other essential tools for program creation and troubleshooting.

14) **SAP HANA Development:** With SAP's move towards HANA, students will learn about developing ABAP for SAP HANA, focusing on optimizing ABAP code to leverage the in-memory database's capabilities, and understanding new paradigms such as CDS Views and AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedures).

15) **Certification Preparation and Guidelines:** The final part of the course will focus on preparing students for the SAP ABAP Certification Exam, covering the exam structure, important topics, and offering tips and strategies for successfully achieving certification.

This comprehensive training program is designed to equip students with a robust foundational and advanced knowledge of ABAP, making them valuable contributors to any SAP implementation or customization project.
