##Full Stack Development Program
Full stack development is an encompassing program that prepares individuals to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of web applications. Front-end development involves working on the client side of the application, dealing with the layout, design, and interactivity using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the other hand, back-end development focuses on the server side, dealing with the database, server, application, and ensuring that everything works seamlessly together, typically using languages and frameworks like Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js, and SQL databases. A full-stack development program equips learners with a comprehensive skill set, allowing them to build complete web applications from scratch, understand the entire software development cycle, and tackle challenges across the full spectrum of web development.
