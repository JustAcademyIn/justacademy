The HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap course is a comprehensive training program designed to equip learners with essential web development skills. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as the backbone of web pages, allowing developers to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and appearance of the HTML content, enabling designers to create visually appealing and responsive websites. Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework, provides a set of CSS and JavaScript tools that simplify the design of responsive and mobile-first web pages. Through this course, participants will gain hands-on experience in crafting responsive websites, understand the fundamentals of web development, and learn how to utilize Bootstrap components to speed up the design process, ultimately preparing them for roles in web design and development.
