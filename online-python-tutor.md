Online Python Tutor is an educational tool developed by Philip Guo that provides a visual platform for learning and teaching the Python programming language, along with several other languages like Java, C, C++, and JavaScript. It allows users, especially beginners, to write Python code in a web-based interface and visualize the execution of their code step by step. This means that as the code runs, the tool graphically illustrates what happens with variables, data structures, function calls, and other programming operations in real-time. It is particularly useful for understanding how algorithms work and debugging purposes. The platform serves as a valuable resource for students, educators, and self-learners to grasp programming concepts more intuitively.
