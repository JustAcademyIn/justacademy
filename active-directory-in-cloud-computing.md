##Active Directory In Cloud Computing

Active Directory in cloud computing refers to the use of Microsoft's cloud-based directory service, Azure Active Directory (AAD), to manage user identities and access controls in cloud-based environments. AAD provides single sign-on capabilities, allowing users to securely access multiple cloud-based applications with a single set of credentials. It also offers features such as multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and integration with on-premises Active Directory environments. By leveraging Active Directory in the cloud, organizations can centralize identity management and enforce consistent security policies across both cloud-based and on-premises resources.
