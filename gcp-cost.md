## GCP Cost

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a flexible and transparent pricing model for its cloud services, allowing users to only pay for the resources they consume. The cost of using GCP can vary based on factors such as the type and amount of services used, data storage, network usage, and location. GCP provides various tools to help users monitor and optimize their costs, such as cost calculators, budget alerts, and usage reports. By carefully monitoring usage and choosing cost-effective options, businesses can effectively manage and control their GCP expenses.
