## Machine Learning in Hawaii

Machine learning in Hawaii involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming, by learning from and making predictions or decisions based on data. In Hawaii, machine learning is being applied in various industries such as tourism, agriculture, and healthcare to improve efficiency, offer personalized experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The technology is also being used in environmental monitoring and conservation efforts to analyze data and identify patterns to better understand and protect Hawaii's unique ecosystems.
