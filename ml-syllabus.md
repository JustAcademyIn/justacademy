## ML Syllabus

A typical machine learning syllabus includes topics such as data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, supervised learning algorithms (including regression and classification), unsupervised learning algorithms (such as clustering and dimensionality reduction), ensemble methods, neural networks, and deep learning. Students will learn how to apply these techniques to real-world datasets, interpret model results, and make data-driven decisions. Practical skills such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model tuning are also typically covered in the syllabus.
