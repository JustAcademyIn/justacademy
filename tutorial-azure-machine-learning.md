1) Introduction to Azure Machine Learning:
This tutorial will cover the basics of Azure Machine Learning, a cloud-based platform that allows users to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models. Students will learn the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as how to use Azure Machine Learning to develop predictive models.

2) Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
In this section, students will learn how to prepare and manipulate data for use in the machine learning models. This includes techniques for handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Students will also learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to automate these steps and save time in the data preparation process.

3) Building and Training Models:
The heart of machine learning is building and training models. In this section, students will learn about different types of models, such as regression and classification, and how to train and evaluate their performance using Azure Machine Learning. They will also explore techniques for avoiding common pitfalls in model training.

4) Deployment and Management:
Once a model is trained, it needs to be deployed in order to generate predictions. In this section, students will learn how to deploy models using Azure Machine Learning, including how to optimize the model's performance and scale it for larger datasets. They will also learn how to monitor and manage their deployed models for ongoing use.

5) Hands-on Projects and Real-world Applications:
To solidify their understanding, students will have the opportunity to work on hands-on projects and explore real-world applications of Azure Machine Learning. They will gain practical experience in building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, and be able to showcase their skills to potential employers. The training program will also provide resources and support for students to continue their learning journey and stay updated on the latest advancements in Azure Machine Learning.
