7) **Affordable Fees**: While prices can vary widely based on the reputation of the institute and depth of the course, look for programs that offer a good balance between cost and quality. There should also be transparent information about any additional fees for materials or certification exams.

8) **Trial Classes/Demos**: If you're unsure about committing to a full course, see if the program offers trial classes or demo sessions. This can give you a taste of the teaching style and course content before you make a financial commitment.

10) **Accessibility and Support Resources**: For those who may need it, check the availability of accessibility resources and support for learners with disabilities. The class should also offer ample support through TAs, forums, or help desks for course-related queries.
