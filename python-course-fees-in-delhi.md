As of my last update, the fees for Python programming courses in Delhi can vary widely depending on the institute, the course's comprehensiveness, and the mode of instruction. Generally, for physical classroom-based training, the fees can range from approximately INR 5,000 for a basic course to over INR 20,000 for advanced and specialized courses that may span a few weeks to several months. Online courses might offer a slight edge in terms of cost, potentially reducing fees due to the lower overhead costs for the providers. Additionally, many institutes and e-learning platforms offer discounts, scholarships, or flexible payment options, which can substantially affect the overall expense. Keep in mind that fees are subject to change, and it's always best to check directly with the course providers for the most accurate and current information.

Certainly! While the exact fees for Python courses in Delhi can vary widely depending on the institute, course duration, and the specifics of the training program, here is an overview in multiple points:

1) **Beginner-Level Courses:** These entry-level Python courses are designed for individuals with little to no background in programming. Fees for beginner courses generally range from INR 5,000 to INR 15,000. These courses cover the basics of Python, including syntax, basic libraries, and fundamental concepts in programming.

2) **Intermediate-Level Courses:** Meant for learners who have a basic understanding of Python, intermediate courses dive deeper into more complex topics such as data structures, object-oriented programming, and database interaction. These courses might be priced between INR 10,000 and INR 25,000.

3) **Advanced-Level Courses:** Tailored for individuals aiming to specialize in areas such as data science, machine learning, or web development using Python, these courses could cost between INR 20,000 to INR 50,000 or more, reflecting the depth and breadth of the curriculum.

4) **Short-Term Workshops:** Many institutes and colleges offer short-term workshops or seminars focusing on specific Python applications, such as web scraping, automation, or using Python in finance. These workshops can range from a day to a few weeks and may cost anywhere from INR 2,000 to INR 10,000.

5) **Online Training Programs:** With the rise of digital learning platforms, several reputable institutions offer online Python courses with fees varying greatly based on the course's comprehensiveness, instructor profile, and certification value. Prices can range from INR 5,000 for basic courses to INR 40,000 for certification programs that include live mentoring, projects, and career support.

6) **Degree and Diploma Programs:** Some universities and educational institutions in Delhi offer degree or diploma programs in computer science or IT with a specialization in Python and related technologies. These programs are significantly more expensive, potentially costing anywhere from INR 50,000 to several lakhs, given their duration and the degree/diploma awarded upon completion.

7) **Corporate Training Programs:** For working professionals, many institutes offer corporate or executive training programs in Python. Tailored to the needs of a business or a group of employees, these programs are usually priced on a per-batch basis rather than per individual, with costs easily exceeding INR 1,00,000, depending on the course's length and depth.

8) **Bootcamps:** Intensive Python bootcamps that offer immersive learning experiences can also be found in Delhi. Bootcamps are known for their focus on practical skills, project work, and sometimes job placement services. Depending on the duration (ranging from a few weeks to several months), bootcamp costs can vary from INR 30,000 to INR 1,50,000.

Please note, the above fees are approximate and can vary greatly based on the institution, the course's reputation, and the additional services provided (such as placement assistance, project mentoring, etc.). It's advisable to directly contact the educational institutions for the most accurate and current course fees.
