Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and scalable code that can be easily maintained and extended. In Java, a popular OOP language, classes and objects are used to encapsulate data and behavior, providing a more efficient and structured way to write programs. This course teaches the concepts and principles of OOP in Java, including topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling students to design and develop robust and efficient applications.
