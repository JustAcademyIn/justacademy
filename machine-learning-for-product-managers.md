## Machine Learning for Product Managers

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed. For product managers, understanding machine learning can be beneficial in developing data-driven products that provide personalized recommendations, improve user experience, optimize processes, and predict consumer behavior. By leveraging machine learning techniques, product managers can enhance decision-making processes, drive innovation, and deliver more value to customers. It is crucial for product managers to collaborate with data scientists and utilize machine learning to stay competitive in the increasingly data-driven business landscape.
