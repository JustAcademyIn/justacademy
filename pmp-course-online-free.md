A Project Management Professional (PMP) course online free, is a resource offered by various educational platforms, aimed at individuals looking to gain or enhance their project management skills without the financial burden of tuition fees. These courses typically cover the fundamentals of project management, including planning, execution, monitoring, control, and closing of projects, aligned with the standards set by the Project Management Institute (PMI). While free courses may not offer the full depth or the certification exam at the end, they are an excellent starting point for newcomers or a refresher for seasoned professionals. They often include a mix of video lectures, downloadable resources, and interactive forums to engage with other learners. Although these free courses can provide valuable knowledge, pursuing the official PMP certification would still require passing the PMI exam and meeting their professional and educational criteria.
