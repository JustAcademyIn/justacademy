HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It provides the structure for web pages, including text, images, and other multimedia, and allows developers to create interactive and dynamic websites. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, on the other hand, is used to style web pages and make them visually appealing. Both HTML and CSS are essential skills for anyone looking to build a career in web development, and there are many free courses available online that can teach you the fundamentals of both languages. By learning HTML and CSS, you can create beautiful and functional websites without having to spend any money on expensive courses.
