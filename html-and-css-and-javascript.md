HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three essential components of web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for its appearance and design, while JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to the webpage. Together, these technologies work hand in hand to create the dynamic and visually appealing websites we see today. HTML defines the content and layout of a webpage, CSS styles and enhances its appearance, and JavaScript enables user interactions and animations. Understanding and mastering these three languages is crucial for creating engaging and responsive websites.
