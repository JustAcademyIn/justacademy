## HTML CSS Interview Questions

During interviews for web development positions, candidates are commonly asked about HTML and CSS to assess their front-end development skills. Some common HTML interview questions include understanding the structure and elements of HTML, semantic markup, accessibility practices, and best practices for SEO optimization. CSS interview questions often focus on selectors, specificity, the box model, positioning techniques, responsive design principles, and cross-browser compatibility. Candidates may also be asked to demonstrate their ability to style web pages, troubleshoot layout issues, and create responsive designs. Additionally, questions about the latest CSS features, preprocessors like SASS and LESS, and CSS frameworks may also be included to gauge the candidate's knowledge and expertise in front-end development.
