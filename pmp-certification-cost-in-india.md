The cost of Project Management Professional (PMP) certification in India can vary based on various factors including the mode of training chosen (self-learning, online instructor-led, or classroom training), membership status with the Project Management Institute (PMI), and examination retake fees if applicable. As of my last update in 2023, for PMI members, the examination fee is approximately $405 (USD), while for non-members it is about $555 (USD). Additionally, PMI membership costs around $139 (USD), with an annual renewal fee. Preparatory courses and study materials can also add to the overall cost and may range between ₹15,000 to ₹70,000 or more, depending on the institution and the depth of the course. Considering these factors, candidates in India must assess both the direct costs (examination and membership fees) and indirect costs (training and study materials) when planning for PMP certification. It's critical to research and choose the right preparation course and mode of study to ensure a balance between cost effectiveness and quality of preparation.
