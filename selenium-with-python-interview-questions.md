1) What is Selenium and why is it used in Python?
Selenium is a powerful automation tool commonly used for testing web applications. When combined with Python, Selenium allows programmers to write automated web tests that can simulate user interactions on a web page.

2) How to install Selenium in Python?
Students will learn how to install the Selenium package in Python using pip, the package installer for Python. They will also be shown how to set up a Selenium WebDriver for their preferred web browser.

3) What is the difference between find_element() and find_elements() in Selenium?
Students will be taught the distinctions between these two methods in Selenium. find_element() is used to locate a single element on a web page, while find_elements() is used to locate multiple elements that match the specified criteria.

4) How to handle dynamic elements in Selenium using Python?
Training will cover techniques for handling dynamic web elements that may change in real-time. Students will learn how to use methods such as WebDriverWait and to dynamically locate elements using xpath, CSS selectors, and other locators.

5) What are the different types of waits in Selenium?
The program will explain the three types of waits in Selenium: implicit, explicit, and fluent waits. Students will understand when to use each type of wait and how to implement them effectively in their test scripts.

6) How to take screenshots in Selenium using Python?
Students will learn how to capture screenshots of web pages during test execution using Selenium with Python. This skill is valuable for debugging and reporting test results.

7) What are the benefits of using Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium with Python?
The training will cover the benefits of implementing the Page Object Model design pattern in Selenium tests written in Python. Students will understand how POM improves test readability, maintainability, and reusability.

8) How to perform keyboard and mouse actions using Selenium in Python?
Students will be taught how to simulate keyboard and mouse interactions on web elements using the Actions class in Selenium with Python. This includes actions like clicking, double-clicking, dragging and dropping, and more.

9) What are the different types of locators supported by Selenium in Python?
The program will introduce students to various types of locators, such as ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, and xpath, that can be used to identify web elements on a page while writing test scripts in Python.

10) How to handle pop-up windows in Selenium using Python?
Students will learn methods to handle various types of pop-up windows (alerts, prompts, and confirmations) that may appear during the execution of test scripts in Selenium with Python.

11) How to perform browser navigation using Selenium in Python?
Training will include navigation techniques such as opening a new tab, switching between tabs, refreshing a page, navigating backward and forward, and closing a browser window using Selenium in Python.

12) What is the use of ActionChains class in Selenium with Python?
Students will understand the purpose of the ActionChains class in Selenium and how it can be used to perform complex interactions involving a sequence of mouse and keyboard actions on web elements.

13) How to handle iframes in Selenium using Python?
The training will provide guidance on how to interact with elements inside iframes (inline frames) on a web page using Selenium with Python. Students will learn how to switch between frames and perform actions within them.

14) How to run parallel tests using Selenium Grid with Python?
Students will be introduced to Selenium Grid, a tool that enables running tests in parallel across multiple machines and browsers. They will gain insights into setting up a Selenium Grid and distributing tests for faster execution.

15) What are the best practices for writing efficient and maintainable Selenium tests in Python?
The program will highlight key best practices to help students write high-quality Selenium test scripts in Python. These practices include using proper naming conventions, organizing tests in a modular manner, handling exceptions effectively, and more.

16) How to generate test reports using Selenium with Python?
Students will learn how to generate comprehensive test reports that provide insights into test execution status, pass/fail results, and performance metrics using reporting tools such as HTMLTestRunner or Allure with Selenium in Python.

17) How to handle dropdowns and select options in Selenium with Python?
The training will cover techniques for interacting with dropdown menus and selecting options using the Select class in Selenium with Python. Students will learn how to handle single and multi-select dropdowns, and handle dynamic dropdowns.

18) How to deal with AJAX calls in Selenium with Python?
Students will be guided on handling AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) calls in Selenium tests written in Python. They will learn how to wait for AJAX responses to complete before proceeding with test execution.

19) What are the common issues encountered while working with Selenium in Python and how to resolve them?
The program will address common challenges faced by testers when using Selenium with Python, such as synchronization issues, handling dynamic elements, dealing with slow loading pages, and suggest potential solutions to overcome these obstacles.

20) How to integrate Selenium tests with Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins using Python?
Students will understand the significance of automation testing in CI/CD pipelines and learn how to set up and run Selenium tests in Jenkins using Python. They will gain practical experience in integrating Selenium tests into the CI process for automated execution and reporting.
