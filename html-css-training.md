##Html Css Training

HTML and CSS training provides individuals with the knowledge and skills to create visually appealing and functional websites. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to design and style the layout. In this training, participants learn how to write HTML code to create content, structure, and links, as well as use CSS to enhance the appearance of websites through color, typography, and layout. Through hands-on practice and exercises, students gain proficiency in coding and design principles, preparing them for a career in web development or enhancing their existing skills in the field.
