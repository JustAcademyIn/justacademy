##Oracle Database vs MySQL

Oracle Database and MySQL are two popular relational database management systems used for storing and managing data. Oracle Database is a comprehensive, enterprise-level database system known for its scalability, high performance, and advanced features such as advanced security and data integrity capabilities. It is ideal for large organizations with complex data requirements. On the other hand, MySQL is an open-source database management system that is lightweight, easy to use, and well-suited for small to medium-sized businesses. While MySQL lacks some of the advanced features of Oracle Database, it is highly customizable and cost-effective for startups and small businesses.
