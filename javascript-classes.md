JavaScript classes are a way of creating objects with defined properties and methods, similar to classes in other programming languages. They allow for the organization and encapsulation of code, making it easier to create and manage complex programs. Classes can have constructor methods for initializing objects, as well as other methods for manipulating and interacting with those objects. They also support inheritance, allowing for the creation of subclasses with their own unique properties and methods. Overall, classes in JavaScript provide a structured and efficient way to create and use objects, making code more readable and maintainable.

1) Classes in Javascript are a way of organizing and creating objects with shared properties and methods. This is done in order to promote code reusability and maintainability.
2) They are defined by the 'class' keyword followed by a name and a code block containing the properties and methods.
3) Classes can have a 'constructor' method which is automatically called when the class is instantiated. This allows for setting initial values for properties.
4) The 'extends' keyword can be used to create a subclass of a parent class, allowing for inheritance of properties and methods.
5) Classes also have 'static' methods, which are methods that can be called directly on the class itself without needing an instance of the class. This can be useful for utility functions or helper methods.
