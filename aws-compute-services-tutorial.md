1) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers by allowing them to have complete control over their computing resources.

2) AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. This eliminates the need for developers to provision and manage servers, making it a cost-effective option for hosting applications and services.

3) Elastic Container Service (ECS): ECS is a highly scalable and highly available container orchestration service that allows developers to easily run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. It provides a scalable, reliable, and secure platform for deploying, running, and scaling containerized applications.

4) Elastic Beanstalk: Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed in various programming languages, such as Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. It automatically manages the underlying infrastructure and handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

5) AWS Batch: AWS Batch enables developers to run batch computing workloads on the AWS cloud. It dynamically provisions and optimizes compute resources based on the volume and complexity of the job. This allows for efficient and cost-effective processing of large amounts of data without the need for manual infrastructure management.
