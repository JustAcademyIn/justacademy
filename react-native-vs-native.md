##React Native vs Native

React Native is a popular framework that allows developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It offers the advantage of code reusability across different operating systems, such as iOS and Android, resulting in faster development and cost-effective maintenance. On the other hand, native app development involves writing separate codebases for each platform, enabling developers to utilize platform-specific features and providing better performance and user experience. The choice between React Native and native development typically depends on project requirements, such as time constraints, budget, and desired feature set.

1) React Native:
  - React Native is a popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
  - It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms such as iOS and Android.
  - React Native uses a single codebase for both platforms, which can save time and resources.
  - It offers a large community of developers and ready-to-use components that can accelerate development.
  - React Native apps can have near-native performance and look and feel, making them a good choice for many projects.
  - Developer-friendly hot reloading feature speeds up the development process by showing changes instantly.

2) Native:
  - Native app development involves creating separate codebases for different platforms (iOS and Android).
  - Developers use platform-specific languages and tools like Swift for iOS and Java or Kotlin for Android.
  - Native apps can take full advantage of platform-specific features and capabilities, resulting in a highly optimized user experience.
  - They often have better performance and access to device-specific functions compared to cross-platform solutions.
  - Native app development requires more specialized skills and knowledge of platform-specific development environments.
  - Updates and maintenance may take longer due to separate codebases and testing requirements for each platform.
