##What Does Mern Stand For

MERN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It is a popular stack of technologies used for building full-stack web applications. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Express is a web application framework for Node.js, React is a front-end library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Combining these technologies allows developers to create dynamic and scalable web applications efficiently.
