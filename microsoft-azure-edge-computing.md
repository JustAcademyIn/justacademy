This enables real-time decision making, better user experiences, and optimized operations for various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and retail. With Azure Edge Computing, businesses can take advantage of edge devices, IoT solutions, and hybrid cloud environments to drive innovation and enhance their digital transformation efforts.
