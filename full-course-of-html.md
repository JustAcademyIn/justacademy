A full course in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) typically encompasses the fundamental building blocks for creating web pages and web applications. Such a course starts with the basics of HTML structure, including elements, tags, and attributes, then progresses to working with text, images, links, lists, and tables to design the content and layout of web pages. It also covers more advanced topics like forms for input, integrating multimedia elements (video, audio), and using iframes. Additionally, a comprehensive course might introduce HTML5's latest features, such as semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`), which help create more accessible and SEO-friendly web pages. The course aims to equip learners with a thorough understanding and practical skills to write clean, efficient, and modern HTML code, laying a foundation for further studies in web development, including CSS and JavaScript, to style and add interactivity to web pages.
