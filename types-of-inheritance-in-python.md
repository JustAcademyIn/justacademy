In Python, inheritance enables a class, known as a child or subclass, to derive properties and functionalities from another class, referred to as the parent or superclass. There are several types of inheritance, including single inheritance, where a subclass inherits from only one superclass; multiple inheritance, where a subclass can inherit from more than one superclass; multilevel inheritance, involving a hierarchy where a subclass acts as a superclass for another subclass; and hierarchical inheritance, where multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass. Lastly, hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, allowing for complex inheritance relationships and hierarchical structures to accommodate various programming needs, enhancing code reusability and efficiency.

Sure, I'd be pleased to outline the types of inheritance in Python, which is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of a new class that inherits attributes and behaviors from existing classes. This facilitates code reusability and simplicity. Here are the main types of inheritance in Python:

1) **Single Inheritance:** In single inheritance, a derived (child) class is created from a single base (parent) class, inheriting its attributes and methods. This is the simplest form of inheritance, enabling specialized behavior atop the base class's functionality.

    ```python
    class Parent:
        pass  # Parent class code
    
    class Child(Parent):
        pass  # Additional or overridden code for the child
    ```

2) **Multiple Inheritance:** A derived class is created from more than one base class, inheriting attributes and methods from all the parent classes. Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to combine the functionalities of multiple parent classes.

    ```python
    class Father:
        pass  # Father's class code
    
    class Mother:
        pass  # Mother's class code
    
    class Child(Father, Mother):
        pass  # Inherits attributes and methods from both parents
    ```

3) **Multilevel Inheritance:** This type of inheritance involves multiple levels of inheritance, where a class is derived from a base class, and then another class is derived from this derived class, forming a parent-grandparent relationship. Each derived class inherits from its immediate parent class.

    ```python
    class Grandparent:
        pass  # Base class code
    
    class Parent(Grandparent):
        pass  # Inherits from Grandparent
    
    class Child(Parent):
        pass  # Inherits from Parent, which inherits from Grandparent
    ```

4) **Hierarchical Inheritance:** In this scenario, multiple classes are derived from a single base class, creating a tree-like structure of inheritance. Each derived class inherits from the same base class but remains independent of each other.

    ```python
    class Parent:
        pass  # Base class code

    class Son(Parent):
        pass  # Inherits from Parent

    class Daughter(Parent):
        pass  # Also inherits from Parent
    ```

5) **Hybrid Inheritance:** This is a combination of two or more types of inheritance (above mentioned). For example, it may involve multiple and multilevel inheritance working together. Python allows for such complex inheritance structures, but they should be used with caution to avoid complexity and ambiguity.

    ```python
    class Base:
        pass  # Base class code

    class Derived1(Base):
        pass  # Inherits from Base

    class Derived2(Base):
        pass  # Also inherits from Base

    class Child(Derived1, Derived2):
        pass  # Inherits from both Derived1 and Derived2, example of hybrid inheritance
    ```

If offering a training program to students, it would be helpful to not only explain these concepts but also to provide practical examples and exercises for each type. This hands-on approach can help reinforce the concepts and enable learners to see how inheritance can be used in real-world programming scenarios.
