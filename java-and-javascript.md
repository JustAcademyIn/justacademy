Java and JavaScript are both programming languages that are commonly used in web development. Java is a robust, object-oriented language that is widely used for creating web applications, desktop applications, and mobile applications. It runs on a virtual machine, making it platform-independent and highly secure. On the other hand, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted language that is primarily used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It runs directly on the browser, making it ideal for creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. Despite having similar names, Java and JavaScript are different languages with different purposes and syntax, but they are often used together in web development to create powerful and engaging applications.
