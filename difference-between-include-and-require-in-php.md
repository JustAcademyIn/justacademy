##Difference between include and require in PHP

In PHP, both include and require are used to include and evaluate external files in your code. The main difference between them is how they handle errors. When using include, if the file is not found or unable to be included for any reason, the script will continue to execute with a warning message. On the other hand, when using require, if the file is not found or unable to be included, it will result in a fatal error and halt the script execution. It is generally recommended to use require when the file being included is essential for the script to run correctly, and use include when the file is optional.

1) **Include vs Require in PHP** 

1) Both `include` and `require` are PHP functions used to include the contents of another file into the current file during script execution.
2) Using `include` and `require` helps in breaking down large programs into smaller, more manageable files.
3) The main difference between `include` and `require` is the way they handle errors.
4) When the file provided in the `include` statement is not found, a warning is issued, but the script continues to execute.
5) Conversely, when the file provided in the `require` statement is not found, a fatal error occurs, and the script halts execution.
6) Therefore, `require` is considered a stricter approach compared to `include`.
7) If the file to be included is critical to the script execution, `require` would be the better choice to ensure the script only continues if the required file is successfully included.
8) `Include` can be useful when including non-essential files or files that are more optional.
9) Another difference is that if a file is included multiple times using `include`, it will not raise a warning, but `require` will trigger a fatal error if the same file is required more than once.
10) Both `include` and `require` accept both absolute and relative paths to the file.
11) When including a file using `require`, the file path must be correct, otherwise, it will lead to a fatal error.
12) Including files using `include` or `require` is a common practice to reuse code, modularize projects, and improve maintainability.
13) It is important to understand the differences between the two functions to use them effectively and ensure proper script execution.
14) `Include` and `require` statements are often used in PHP frameworks to include libraries, classes, or configuration files.
15) While `include` and `require` both serve the purpose of including files, the distinction lies in error handling and script behavior.
16) Understanding when to use `include` and when to use `require` can help in writing efficient, error-resistant PHP scripts.
17) PHP provides other variations of these functions such as `include_once` and `require_once`, which ensure that a file is included only once to avoid duplication.
18) Training students on the differences between `include` and `require` can help them create more robust and efficient PHP applications.
19) Hands-on exercises demonstrating the effects of using `include` and `require` incorrectly can enhance students' understanding of these functions.
20) Regular practice and exposure to real-world scenarios can sharpen students' skills in utilizing `include` and `require` effectively in PHP development.
