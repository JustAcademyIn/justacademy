## Design Basics

Design basics are fundamental principles that guide the creation of visual compositions. They include elements such as balance, alignment, contrast, repetition, and proportion. Balance ensures that elements are distributed evenly in a design, while alignment creates cohesion and order. Contrast emphasizes differences to create visual interest, while repetition creates consistency and unity. Proportion ensures that elements are appropriately sized in relation to one another. By understanding and applying these design basics, creators can produce visually appealing and effective designs across various mediums.
