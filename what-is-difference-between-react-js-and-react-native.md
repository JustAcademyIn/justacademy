##What Is Difference Between React JS and React Native

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces by using reusable components. In contrast, React Native is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. While React JS targets web development, React Native targets mobile development for both iOS and Android platforms, enabling developers to write code once and run it on multiple platforms. Both React JS and React Native share the same syntax and principles, making it easier for developers to transition between the two technologies.

1) React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web, while React Native is a mobile framework for building native apps for iOS and Android.
2) React JS uses Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance by updating only the necessary parts of the webpage, while React Native uses Native components to render user interfaces.
3) React JS is mainly used for web development, whereas React Native is used for mobile app development.
4) React JS applications run in the browser, while React Native applications run on a mobile device as a standalone app.
5) React JS uses HTML and CSS for styling, while React Native uses its own styling components to render UI elements on mobile devices.
6) React JS does not support mobile-specific features like accessing the camera or GPS directly, while React Native has built-in APIs for accessing device features.
7) React JS is platform-independent, while React Native requires separate codebases for iOS and Android apps.
8) React JS is typically used for building responsive websites, while React Native is used for building native mobile apps with a more native look and feel.
9) React JS has a larger ecosystem with many third-party libraries and tools available, while React Native has a smaller but growing ecosystem.
10) React JS is better suited for web applications that require SEO optimization, while React Native is ideal for building performance-oriented mobile apps.
11) React JS is easier to learn for beginners in web development, while React Native requires some familiarity with mobile app development concepts.
12) React JS is usually faster to develop applications for a single platform, while React Native can save time by allowing for code sharing between iOS and Android apps.
13) React JS is more suitable for projects with a limited budget, while React Native may require more resources due to its mobile-specific requirements.
14) React JS has a larger community of developers, making it easier to find support and resources, while React Native has a smaller but dedicated community.
15) React JS applications can be easier to deploy and maintain, as they only require a web server for hosting, while React Native apps need to go through app store approval processes.
16) React JS can be used for building both simple and complex web applications, while React Native is primarily used for building mobile apps.
17) React JS has a wider range of available developer tools and extensions compared to React Native.
18) React JS allows for progressive web app development, while React Native is specifically designed for mobile app development.
19) React JS has more flexibility in terms of integrating with other frameworks and libraries, while React Native has more limitations due to its mobile-specific nature.
20) React JS has a larger job market for web developers, while React Native developers are in high demand for mobile app development positions.
