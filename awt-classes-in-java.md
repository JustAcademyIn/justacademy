AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) classes in Java are a set of APIs that provide a platform-independent way to create and manage user interface components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and windows. These classes are a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and allow Java developers to design and create graphical user interfaces for their applications. AWT classes provide a high level of abstraction, making it easier to create GUIs without having to worry about low-level details such as operating system specificities. These classes also offer a wide range of event handling mechanisms, making it possible to create interactive and responsive applications.
