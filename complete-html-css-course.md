The Complete HTML CSS Course is a comprehensive learning program designed to equip beginners and intermediate learners with a thorough understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). HTML serves as the backbone of web development, allowing the creation of the structure and content of web pages, while CSS enhances these web pages by defining their layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance. This type of course typically covers everything from the basics, such as understanding tags and elements, creating forms, and embedding media, to more sophisticated styling techniques with CSS, including the use of selectors, the box model, responsive design principles, and flexbox or grid systems. The aim is to provide students with the practical skills needed to build and style websites from scratch, ensuring they are visually appealing, user-friendly, and compatible across different browsers and devices.
