## MACHINE LEARNING for KIDS

Machine learning is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions by themselves. It is a type of technology that allows computers to analyze large amounts of data and find patterns to make predictions or decisions. For kids, machine learning can be a fun way to understand how computers learn and improve over time, such as through games or interactive activities. It can also help kids understand how technology powers many aspects of our daily lives, from personalized recommendations on streaming services to self-driving cars. By introducing machine learning concepts early on, kids can develop a foundational understanding of this important technology.
