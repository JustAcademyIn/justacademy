##CLOUD ENGINEER vs DEVOPS ENGINEER

Cloud engineers focus on designing, implementing, and managing cloud infrastructure and services, ensuring scalability, availability, and security. They work on deploying and maintaining applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. On the other hand, DevOps engineers emphasize automating and optimizing the software development lifecycle by integrating development and operations teams. They focus on continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, and monitoring to streamline the development process and improve collaboration between teams. While both roles involve working with cloud technologies, cloud engineers typically focus on infrastructure while DevOps engineers focus on the entire software delivery process.
