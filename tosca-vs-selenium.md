##Tosca vs Selenium

TOSCA and Selenium are both automation testing tools, but they have different approaches and features. TOSCA is a comprehensive test automation suite that offers model-based testing, making it easier to create and maintain test scripts. It provides a wide range of functionalities beyond just automation, such as test case design, test data management, and reporting. On the other hand, Selenium is a popular open-source tool specifically designed for web application testing. It supports various programming languages and browsers and is highly flexible and customizable. While TOSCA is more suitable for large enterprise applications due to its comprehensive features, Selenium is preferred by many for its flexibility and cost-effectiveness, especially for web applications. Ultimately, the choice between TOSCA and Selenium depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the testing team and organization.
