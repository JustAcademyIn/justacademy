## PNP Certification

The PNP certification, also known as the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Certification, is a specialized credential designed for nurses who wish to work as advanced practice providers in the field of pediatric care. To achieve this certification, nurses must complete graduate-level education with a focus on pediatric care, obtain relevant clinical experience, and pass a rigorous national certification exam administered by the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB) or the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). This certification signifies a nurse's advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities in providing evidence-based care to pediatric patients, from infancy through adolescence, and is essential for those seeking to advance their careers in pediatric healthcare.
