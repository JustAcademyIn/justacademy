## Selenium Mobile Testing

Selenium mobile testing is a method of testing mobile applications using Selenium, an open-source automation tool. This approach enables testers to automate the testing of web applications on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. By leveraging tools like Appium, which extends Selenium to support mobile platforms, testers can execute tests on both Android and iOS devices. Selenium mobile testing helps ensure the functionality, performance, and compatibility of mobile applications across different devices and platforms, leading to better quality and user experience for mobile users.
