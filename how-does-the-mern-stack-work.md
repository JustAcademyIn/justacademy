The MERN stack is a popular web development architecture that uses four technologies: MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node.js. It follows a JavaScript-based approach to building modern, dynamic web applications. MongoDB acts as the database, ExpressJS handles server-side logic and routing, React is used for frontend development, and Node.js is the runtime environment for server-side code. This combination of technologies allows for a seamless flow of data and communication between the frontend and backend, resulting in efficient and rapid application development.

1) The MERN stack is a combination of four different technologies - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

2) MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, used to store and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable manner.

3) Express.js is a back-end web framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications and APIs.

4) React is a front-end web framework that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

5) Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it a popular choice for building server-side applications. 

By offering a training program on the MERN stack, students can learn how to build full-stack web applications using the latest technologies and techniques. They will gain a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, as well as database management.
