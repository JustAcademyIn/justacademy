An Object-Oriented Python course typically focuses on teaching the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using the Python programming language. It introduces students to the basic principles of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, through hands-on Python examples and exercises. Learners are guided on how to structure their code efficiently by designing and implementing reusable classes, understanding how to model real-world problems using objects, and applying OOP methodologies to create clean, efficient, and scalable Python applications. By the end of the course, participants should be comfortable with Python's object-oriented features, enabling them to tackle more complex programming challenges and build sophisticated applications more effectively.

1) **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: This initial section would cover the basics of OOP in Python, explaining fundamental concepts like classes, objects, methods, and inheritance. It will offer an overview of how OOP enhances code reusability and modularity.

2) **Classes and Objects**: Students will learn how to define classes and create objects in Python. This includes understanding the `__init__` method, self-parameter, and how to encapsulate data and functions into a single entity.

3) **Method Types and Inheritance**: The course will delve into different types of methods in Python - instance methods, class methods, static methods - and their specific use cases. It will also cover inheritance and how to create child classes that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.

4) **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Lessons on encapsulation will teach students how to restrict access to methods and variables to prevent the data from being modified directly. Abstraction concepts will focus on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

5) **Polymorphism and Operator Overloading**: Students will explore the concept of polymorphism, which allows methods to do different things based on the object that is calling them. This section also covers operator overloading, giving custom objects the ability to respond to built-in Python operators.

6) **Advanced OOP Concepts**: This segment would include advanced topics like multiple inheritance, mix-ins, abstract base classes, and how to utilize them in Python to design clean and efficient code.

7) **Practical Applications of OOP in Python**: The course will provide practical exercises and projects that apply OOP principles to real-world problems. This could involve developing a small web application, a command-line tool, or data models for processing and analyzing data.

8) **Best Practices and Design Patterns**: Students will learn about best practices in OOP, such as adhering to the SOLID principles, and explore common design patterns like Factory, Singleton, and Observer. This knowledge will help in writing maintainable and scalable code.

9) **Testing and Debugging OOP Projects**: Here, the focus will be on techniques for testing and debugging object-oriented Python code. This includes writing unit tests, using Python's `unittest` framework, and employing debugging tools to troubleshoot issues.

10) **Real-World Case Studies**: The course might incorporate case studies that illustrate how OOP principles have been applied in large-scale projects. This will give students insights into practical challenges and solutions in software development.

11) **Guest Lectures and Interviews**: Inviting experienced Python developers and industry experts to share their experiences and tips on OOP could provide valuable insights and motivation for students.

12) **Wrap-Up and Final Project**: The concluding section of the course would review all the key concepts covered and challenge students with a comprehensive final project that requires applying everything they've learned to build a complete, object-oriented application in Python.

Such a course structure offers a thorough understanding of OOP in Python, blending theoretical knowledge with practical skill-building to equip students for real-world software development.
