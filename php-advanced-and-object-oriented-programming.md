PHP Advanced and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that goes beyond basic PHP scripting to leverage more complex, efficient, and reusable code structures. By adopting OOP principles, PHP developers encapsulate data and functionalities within classes and objects, enabling them to create more modular, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Advanced PHP topics often intertwined with OOP include design patterns, which are standardized solutions to common problems; namespaces, which organize code in a way that avoids naming conflicts; and exception handling, which improves error management. Mastery of these concepts allows developers to construct sophisticated web systems that can easily evolve alongside web technologies and user demands.

1) **Introduction to PHP and OOP:** Begin with an overview of PHP as a server-side scripting language and introduce the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications.

2) **PHP OOP Basics:** Discuss the basic concepts of OOP within PHP, including classes, objects, properties, and methods. Explain how to define a class and instantiate an object in PHP.

3) **Encapsulation:** Teach the principle of encapsulation, which involves grouping related properties and methods within a class. Show how access modifiers (public, private, and protected) control access to the class members.

4) **Inheritance:** Cover the concept of inheritance, which allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. Explain the use of the `extends` keyword to implement inheritance in PHP.

5) **Polymorphism:** Introduce polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Explain the use of interfaces and abstract classes to achieve polymorphism in PHP.

6) **Magic Methods:** Teach about PHP's magic methods, such as `__construct()`, `__destruct()`, `__get()`, `__set()`, and how they can be used to perform specific tasks automatically.

7) **Namespaces:** Explain the importance of namespaces in PHP for organizing code into hierarchical groups and avoiding name collisions between classes.

8) **Error and Exception Handling:** Discuss the traditional error handling mechanisms in PHP and move on to modern exception handling using the `try-catch` block. Explain the use of custom exception classes.

9) **Working with Files and Directories:** Demonstrate how to handle file operations in PHP, such as reading, writing, and uploading files. Explain the use of built-in functions for manipulating directories.

10) **Database Operations with PDO:** Introduce PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database operations, emphasizing its advantages such as security (through prepared statements) and database abstraction.

11) **Advanced Database Concepts:** Cover advanced concepts like transactions and joins. Explain how to use transactions for more reliable data operations and how to query multiple tables with joins.

12) **Design Patterns in PHP:** Introduce common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Strategy. Discuss how these patterns can solve common design problems and improve code maintenance.

13) **Unit Testing with PHPUnit:** Explain the importance of testing in software development and introduce PHPUnit as a tool for writing and running tests on PHP code. Show how to write basic tests to ensure code reliability.

14) **RESTful API Development:** Teach the principles of REST and how to create RESTful APIs in PHP. Discuss methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes to communicate with clients effectively.

15) **Frameworks in PHP:** Briefly introduce popular PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter. Discuss the benefits of using frameworks, such as rapid development, built-in functionalities, and community support.

16) **Best Practices in PHP OOP:** Conclude with a focus on best practices in PHP OOP, including coding standards, documentation, security measures (like sanitizing user input), and performance optimization techniques.

This structured program aims to provide students with a solid foundation in PHP and modern Object-Oriented Programming principles, making them well-prepared for developing complex and secure web applications.
