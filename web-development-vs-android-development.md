##WEB DEVELOPMENT VS ANDROID DEVELOPMENT

Web development primarily focuses on creating websites and web applications using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Android development, on the other hand, involves the creation of mobile applications specifically for Android devices using the Java or Kotlin programming languages. While web development caters to a broader audience across different platforms and devices, Android development is tailored specifically for the Android operating system, offering a more focused user experience with mobile app development. Both fields require different skill sets and knowledge, with web development often leaning towards front-end and back-end technologies, while Android development involves understanding mobile app design principles and platform-specific functionalities.
