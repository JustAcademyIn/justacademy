ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library, was developed by Facebook in 2011. It is used for building user interfaces and front-end applications. ReactJS is based on the concept of reusable components, allowing developers to easily create complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces. It also uses a virtual DOM, which makes it faster and more efficient than traditional DOM manipulation. By using ReactJS, developers can build dynamic and highly responsive web applications with ease.

1) React Js is a popular Javascript library used for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers.
2) One of the main advantages of React Js is its ability to create reusable components, making it easier to manage and update large-scale applications.
3) React Js uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the page without the need for a full page refresh, resulting in faster performance.
4) React Js follows a one-way data flow, where data updates are passed from parent components to child components, making it easier to debug and maintain code.
5) It is widely used in building single-page applications (SPAs) and can be integrated with other libraries or frameworks such as Redux or Angular for added functionality. Overall, learning React Js can offer students a valuable skillset for developing modern and responsive web applications.
