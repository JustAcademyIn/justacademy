A Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp is an intensive, structured training program designed to equip participants with comprehensive knowledge and skills in JavaScript, covering both front-end and back-end development. It typically covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks/libraries such as React for front-end and Node.js for back-end, along with database management using MongoDB, Express.js for server-side logic, and often includes modern tools and practices like Git for version control, API development, and deployment techniques. Aimed at beginners or career switchers, the bootcamp format combines theoretical learning with hands-on projects to build a solid portfolio, often culminating in a capstone project. This program enables graduates to pursue careers as Full Stack Developers, capable of designing and developing complete web applications.
