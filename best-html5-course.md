As of my last update in 2023, it would be difficult to single out one specific HTML5 course as the absolute best due to the rapidly evolving nature of web development and the sheer volume of content available online. However, top-rated HTML5 courses generally share a few key characteristics: comprehensive coverage of HTML5 elements, attributes, and semantics; hands-on projects to practice building web pages and applications; accessibility and responsive design principles; and an updated curriculum that reflects the latest in web standards. Platforms like Coursera, Udacity, LinkedIn Learning, and Udemy frequently host courses created by industry professionals and educators from renowned institutions. These courses often receive high marks for their depth of material, clarity of instruction, and the practical skills they impart, making them great options for anyone looking to master HTML5.

Sure! Here's an overview of what an ideal course on HTML5 might offer, encapsulated in key points. This format should help in understanding the comprehensive traits of a beneficial training program:

1) **Comprehensive Curriculum**: The course should cover all fundamental aspects of HTML5, starting from the basics to advanced concepts, including the new semantic elements, form types, multimedia, canvas for drawings, and web storage.

2) **Hands-On Learning**: It should offer plenty of practical exercises, projects, and assignments that allow students to apply what they learn directly. This could involve creating web pages, incorporating multimedia elements, and working with APIs.

3) **Up-to-Date Material**: The course content must be current, reflecting the latest in HTML5 standards and best practices, including responsive design and accessibility guidelines.

4) **Expert Instruction**: Taught by professionals with real-world experience in web development, ensuring that students receive insights into industry practices and emerging trends.

5) **Interactive Learning Tools**: Usage of interactive elements like quizzes, flashcards, and videos to make learning engaging and to help students retain information more effectively.

6) **Support & Mentorship**: Providing students access to one-on-one mentorship or a support community where they can seek help, share their progress, and ask questions outside of the structured curriculum.

7) **Portfolio Projects**: Including significant projects that students can add to their portfolios, demonstrating their proficiency in using HTML5 for practical, real-world applications.

8) **Flexible Learning Schedule**: Offering the flexibility to learn at one's own pace, making it suitable for people with different schedules, including full-time students and working professionals.

9) **Certification Prep**: Incorporating resources and mock tests that prepare students for various HTML5 certifications, adding a valuable credential to their resumes.

10) **Lifetime Access and Updates**: Granting students lifelong access to the course materials, including all future updates, ensuring they can always return to brush up on their skills.

11) **Cross-platform Development**: Teaching students how to use HTML5 in the context of developing cross-platform applications, highlighting its versatility across different browsers and devices.

12) **Accessibility and SEO Best Practices**: Emphasizing the importance of creating web content that is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and following SEO best practices to ensure maximum visibility.

13) **Community and Networking**: Opportunities for students to engage with a wider community of HTML5 developers, facilitating networking, collaboration, and job opportunities.

14) **Feedback and Revision Sessions**: Regular feedback on assignments and projects to help students improve and understand their mistakes, including sessions to revise key concepts and tackle difficult topics.

Choosing a course that ticks most, if not all, of these points would likely provide a comprehensive learning experience in HTML5, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to succeed in the field of web development.
