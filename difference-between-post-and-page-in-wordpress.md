##Difference Between Post and Page in WordPress

In WordPress, a post is typically used for timely and regularly updated content, displayed in reverse chronological order on your blog or website. Posts are organized by categories and tags, and can have comments and trackbacks. On the other hand, a page is typically used for static content that doesn't change often, such as an about us page or a contact page. Pages are not meant to be ordered by date and are usually included in the site's navigation menu for easy access. Overall, posts are more dynamic and time-sensitive, while pages are more static and timeless in nature.

1) **Purpose:** 
   - *Pages* in WordPress are static and are typically used for timeless content such as About Us, Contact Us, and Services pages.
