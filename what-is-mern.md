MERN is a popular web development stack that consists of four open-source technologies: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, ExpressJS is a backend web application framework, ReactJS is a front-end JavaScript library, and Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Together, they form a powerful and efficient toolset for building modern and scalable web applications. MERN has gained popularity due to its ability to handle large-scale applications, its flexibility, and its streamlined data flow between client and server. It is also used in developing full-stack JavaScript applications, making it a popular choice among web developers.
