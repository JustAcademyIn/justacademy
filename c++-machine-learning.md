## C++ Machine Learning

C++ is a high-performance programming language often used in machine learning for its speed and memory efficiency. It allows developers to efficiently implement algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks to create powerful predictive models. With libraries like TensorFlow and Dlib, developers can leverage the performance benefits of C++ while building robust machine learning applications for a wide range of use cases.
