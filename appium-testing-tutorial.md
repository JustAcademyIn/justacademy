## Appium Testing Tutorial

Appium is an open-source tool used for automating mobile and web applications across different platforms. It allows testers to write and execute automated tests for mobile apps on iOS and Android using the same API. Appium follows the WebDriver protocol and supports multiple languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. Test scripts can be written using familiar Selenium commands, making it easier for QA teams to transition from web to mobile testing. Appium provides flexibility and scalability by enabling testing on real devices, emulators, and simulators, making it an essential tool for mobile app testing.
