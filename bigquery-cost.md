## BigQuery Cost

BigQuery cost is based on the amount of data processed by queries, storage used, and streaming inserts. The pricing model is pay-as-you-go, with no upfront costs or termination fees. You are charged per TB processed by queries, per month for storage, and per GB for streaming inserts. BigQuery offers a free tier for querying up to 1TB of data and storing up to 10GB per month, making it cost-effective for small to medium workloads. It's important to optimize queries and manage data volumes to control costs effectively.
